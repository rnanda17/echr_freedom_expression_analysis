       "['Factsheet – Access to Internet and\\nfreedom to receive and impart information and ideas\\nJune 2024\\nThis Factsheet does not bind the Court and is not exhaustive\\nAccess to Internet and freedom to receive\\nand impart information and ideas\\n“[T]he Internet has now become one of the principal means by which\\nindividuals exercise their right to freedom to receive and impart information\\nand ideas, providing as it does essential tools for participation in activities and\\ndiscussions concerning political issues and issues of general interest. ... Moreover, as to\\nthe importance of Internet sites in the exercise of freedom of expression, ‘in the\\nlight of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of\\ninformation, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public’s\\naccess to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general’.\\nUser-generated expressive activity on the Internet provides an unprecedented platform\\nfor the exercise of freedom of expression ...” (Cengiz and Others v. Turkey, judgment of\\n1 December 2015, §§ 49 and 52).\\nArticle 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human\\nRights:\\n“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to\\nhold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by\\npublic authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from\\nrequiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities,\\nmay be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed\\nby law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security,\\nterritorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the\\nprotection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for\\npreventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the\\nauthority and impartiality of the judiciary.”\\nMeasures blocking access to Internet\\nAhmet Yıldırım v. Turkey\\n18 December 2012 (judgment)\\nThis case concerned a court decision to block access to Google Sites, which hosted an\\nInternet site whose owner was facing criminal proceedings for insulting the memory of\\nAtatürk. As a result of the decision, access to all other sites hosted by the service was\\nblocked. The applicant complained that he was unable to access his own Internet site\\nbecause of this measure ordered in the context of criminal proceedings without any\\nconnection to him or his site. He submitted that the measure infringed his right to\\nfreedom to receive and impart information and ideas.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the effects of the measure in question had been arbitrary and the judicial review of\\nthe blocking of access had been insufficient to prevent abuses. The Court accepted that\\nthis was not a blanket ban but rather a restriction on Internet access. However, the\\nlimited effect of the restriction did not lessen its significance, particularly as the InternetFactsheet – Access to Internet and freedom to receive and\\nimpart information and ideas\\nhad now become one of the principal means of exercising the right to freedom of\\nexpression and information. The Court also reiterated in particular that a restriction on\\naccess to a source of information was only compatible with the Convention if a strict\\nlegal framework was in place regulating the scope of a ban and affording the guarantee\\nof judicial review to prevent possible abuses. However, when the criminal court had\\ndecided to block all access to Google Sites, it had simply referred to an opinion from the\\nTelecommunications Directorate (TİB) without ascertaining whether a less far-reaching\\nmeasure could have been taken to block access specifically to the site in question. There\\nwas further no indication that the criminal court had made any attempt to weigh up the\\nvarious interests at stake, in particular by assessing whether it had been necessary to\\nblock all access to Google Sites. In the Court’s view, this shortcoming was a\\nconsequence of the domestic law, which did not lay down any obligation for the courts to\\nexamine whether the wholesale blocking of Google Sites was justified. The courts should\\nhave had regard to the fact that such a measure would render large amounts of\\ninformation inaccessible, thus directly affecting the rights of Internet users and having a\\nsignificant collateral effect.\\nAkdeniz v. Turkey\\n11 March 2014 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the blocking of access to two websites (“myspace.com” and\\n“last.fm”) on the grounds that they streamed music without respecting copyright\\nlegislation. As a regular user of the websites in question, the applicant mainly\\ncomplained about the collateral effect of the measure taken under the law on artistic and\\nintellectual works.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible (incompatible ratione personae),\\nfinding that the mere fact that the applicant – like the other Turkish users of the\\nwebsites in question – had been indirectly affected by a blocking measure against two\\nmusic-sharing websites could not suffice for him to be regarded as a “victim” for the\\npurposes of Article 34 (right of individual application) of the Convention. While stressing\\nthat the rights of internet users are of paramount importance, the Court nevertheless\\nnoted in particular that the two music streaming websites in question had been blocked\\nbecause they operated in breach of copyright law. As a user of these websites,\\nthe applicant had benefited from their services, and he had only been deprived of one\\nway among others of listening to music. The Court further observed that the applicant\\nhad at his disposal many means to access to a range of musical works, without thereby\\ncontravening the rules governing copyright.\\nCengiz and Others v. Turkey\\n1 December 2015 (judgment)\\nThis case concerned the wholesale blocking of access to YouTube, a website enabling\\nusers to send, view and share videos. The applicants, who were active users of the\\nwebsite, complained in particular of an infringement of their right to freedom to receive\\nand impart information and ideas.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the interference resulting from the application of the impugned provision of the law\\nin question did not satisfy the requirement of lawfulness under the Convention and that\\nthe applicants had not enjoyed a sufficient degree of protection. The Court noted in\\nparticular that the applicants, all academics in different universities, had been prevented\\nfrom accessing YouTube for a lengthy period of time and that, as active users, and\\nhaving regard to the circumstances of the case, they could legitimately claim that the\\nblocking order in question had affected their right to receive and impart information and\\nideas. The Court also observed that YouTube was a single platform which enabled\\ninformation of specific interest, particularly on political and social matters, to be\\nbroadcast and citizen journalism to emerge. The Court further found that there was no\\nprovision in the law allowing the domestic courts to impose a blanket blocking order on\\naccess to the Internet, and in the present case to YouTube, on account of one of its\\ncontents.\\n2Factsheet – Access to Internet and freedom to receive and\\nimpart information and ideas\\nVladimir Kharitonov v. Russia, OOO Flavus and Others v. Russia, Bulgakov v.\\nRussia and Engels v. Russia1\\n23 June 2020 (judgments)\\nThese cases concerned the blocking of websites in Russia and, in particular, different\\ntypes of blocking measures, including “collateral” blocking (where the IP address that\\nwas blocked was shared by several sites including the targeted one); “excessive”\\nblocking (where the whole website was blocked because of a single page or file), and\\n“wholesale” blocking (three online media were blocked by the Prosecutor General for\\ntheir coverage of certain news).\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention and a\\nviolation of Article 13 (right to an effective remedy) in conjunction with Article 10.\\nIt highlighted in particular the importance of the Internet as a vital tool in exercising the\\nright to freedom of expression. Among other things, the Court found that the provisions\\nof Russia’s Information Act used to block the websites had produced excessive and\\narbitrary effects and had not provided proper safeguards against abuse.\\nWikimedia Foundation, Inc. v. Turkey\\n1 March 2022 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned a request by the Telecommunications and Information Technology\\nDirectorate for the removal of pages from the applicant foundation’s website and the\\nsubsequent order blocking access to the entire website as it was not technically feasible\\nto block only certain pages. The applicant alleged that the blocking of access to the\\nentire Wikipedia website amounted to unjustified interference with its right to freedom of\\nexpression, and that the procedure for judicial review of blocking orders against websites\\nwas inadequate to prevent abuse. It further alleged that no effective remedy was\\navailable under Turkish law and that its individual application to the Turkish\\nConstitutional Court had been rendered ineffective since its activity consisted in\\npublishing the content of its webpages in a timely manner.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible, finding that the applicant could\\nno longer claim victim status. It observed, in particular, that it had found, in numerous\\ncases concerning freedom of expression, that an application to the Constitutional Court\\nwas to be regarded as a remedy to be exhausted for the purposes of Article 35 § 1\\n(admissibility criteria) of the Convention in respect of such complaints. The Court took\\nnote of the systemic nature of the problem raised in the present case. Nevertheless,\\nit did not have sufficiently relevant information to suggest that the Turkish Constitutional\\nCourt was not capable of remedying the problem. That court had delivered several\\njudgments concerning the blocking of websites, establishing numerous criteria to be\\nfollowed by the national authorities and the courts called upon to examine blocking\\norders. In the present case, the Court found that in ruling on the individual application\\nbefore it the Constitutional Court had acknowledged in substance the violation of\\nArticle 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention and had afforded appropriate and\\nsufficient redress for the damage sustained by the applicant foundation.\\nTaganrog LRO and Others v. Russia2\\n7 June 2022 (judgment)\\nThis case concerned various actions taken by the Russian State against Jehovah’s\\nWitnesses religious organisations in Russia over a ten-year span, including amendments\\nto anti-extremist legislation leading to the banning of their international website.\\nThe Court held, inter alia, that there had been a violation of Article 10 of\\nthe Convention read in the light of Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and\\nreligion) on account of the designation of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ international website\\nas “extremist”, finding that the decision to block access to the entire website had been\\nunlawful and disproportionate, all the more so as “Watchtower New York”, the website\\n1. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the European Convention on Human\\nRights (“the Convention”).\\n2. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n3Factsheet – Access to Internet and freedom to receive and\\nimpart information and ideas\\nowner, had taken down the offending publications in the meantime. The Court noted\\nin particular, in that regard, that preventing access to the Jehovah’s Witnesses website\\nfrom within Russia had amounted to “interference by a public authority” with the right of\\n“Watchtower New York” to disseminate information to individual Jehovah’s Witnesses\\nand other interested persons in Russia. It had also prevented the Administrative Centre\\nof Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia from receiving and imparting information\\nto its members. The Court also observed that, for the applicants with visual or hearing\\nimpairments, the website had been the only accessible source of downloadable religious\\nmaterials addressing their specific needs. Lastly, in examining whether the interference\\nhad been legal and necessary, the Court noted that “Watchtower New York” had been\\ngiven no prior warning, nor the opportunity to remove the allegedly illegal material from\\nthe website. It had also not been invited to participate in the ensuing hearing.\\nSee also:\\nKablis v. Russia3\\n30 April 2019 (judgment)\\nRFE/RL Inc. and Others v.

Turkey (no. 35278/20)\\nApplication communicated to the Turkish Government on 9 February 2021\\nThis application concerns the restriction of access to 111 contents on the Internet (news\\nsites, video sites and social network accounts) by a decision adopted in October 2015 by\\nthe telecommunications administrative entity.\\nThe Court gave notice of the application to the Turkish Government and put questions to\\nthe parties under Article 10 (freedom of expression) and Article 18 (limitation on use of\\nrestrictions on rights) of the Convention.\\nRestrictions placed on prisoner’s access to certain Internet sites\\nInternet sites containing legal information\\nKalda v. Estonia\\n19 January 2016 (judgment)\\nThis case concerned a prisoner’s complaint about the authorities’ refusal to grant him\\naccess to three Internet websites, containing legal information, run by the State and by\\nthe Council of Europe. The applicant complained in particular that the ban under\\nEstonian law on his accessing these specific websites had breached his right to receive\\ninformation via the Internet and prevented him from carrying out legal research for court\\nproceedings in which he was engaged.\\n3. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n4. This judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 (final judgments) of the\\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\\n4Factsheet – Access to Internet and freedom to receive and\\nimpart information and ideas\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the refusal to grant the applicant access to Internet websites containing legal\\ninformation had breached his right to receive information. The Court noted in particular\\nthat Contracting States are not obliged to grant prisoners access to Internet. It found,\\nhowever, that if a State was willing to allow prisoners access, as was the case in Estonia,\\nit had to give reasons for refusing access to specific sites. In the specific circumstances\\nof the applicant’s case, the reasons, namely the security and costs implications, for not\\nallowing him access to the Internet sites in question had not been sufficient to justify the\\ninterference with his right to receive information. Notably, the authorities had already\\nmade security arrangements for prisoners’ use of Internet via computers specially\\nadapted for that purpose and under the supervision of the prison authorities and had\\nborne the related costs. Indeed, the domestic courts had undertaken no detailed analysis\\nas to the possible security risks of access to the three additional websites in question,\\nbearing in mind that they were run by an international organisation and by the\\nState itself.\\nRamazan Demir v. Turkey\\n9 February 2021 (judgment)\\nThis case concerned the prison authorities’ refusal to grant a request for access to\\ncertain Internet sites, lodged by the applicant, a lawyer, in the course of his pre-trial\\ndetention in Silivri Prison in 2016. The applicant wished to access the Internet sites of\\nthe European Court of Human Rights, the Constitutional Court and the Official Gazette,\\nwith a view to preparing his own defence and following his clients’ cases. He considered\\nthat there had been an interference with his right to receive information and ideas.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the Turkish Government had not shown that the reasons adduced by the national\\nauthorities to justify the measure being challenged had been relevant and sufficient, or\\nthat this interference had been necessary in a democratic society. The Court considered\\nin particular that since prisoners’ access to certain sites containing legal information had\\nalready been granted under Turkish law for the purposes of training and rehabilitation,\\nthe restriction of the applicant’s access to the sites, which contained only legal\\ninformation that could be relevant to the applicant’s development and rehabilitation in\\nthe context of his profession and interests, had constituted an interference with his right\\nto receive information. The Court noted in this connection that the domestic courts had\\nnot provided sufficient explanations as to why the applicant’s access to the Internet sites\\nof the Court, the Constitutional Court or the Official Gazette could not be considered as\\npertaining to the applicant’s training and rehabilitation, for which prisoners’ access to the\\nInternet was authorised by the national legislation, nor on whether and why the\\napplicant ought to be considered as a prisoner posing a certain danger or belonging to\\nan illegal organisation, in respect of whom Internet access could be restricted.\\nFurthermore, neither the authorities nor the Government had explained why the\\ncontested measure had been necessary in the present case, having regard to the\\nlegitimate aims of maintaining order and safety in the prison and preventing crime.\\nInternet sites providing educational information\\nJankovskis v. Lithuania\\n17 January 2017 (judgment)\\nThis case concerned a prisoner’s complaint that he had been refused access to a website\\nrun by the Ministry of Education and Science, thus preventing him from receiving\\neducation-related information. He had written to that Ministry requesting information\\nabout the possibility of enrolling at university in order to acquire a degree in law, and the\\nMinistry had written back to him, informing him that information about study\\nprogrammes could be found on its website. However, the prison authorities and\\nsubsequently the administrative courts all refused to grant the applicant Internet access\\nto this website, essentially referring to the legal ban on prisoners having Internet access\\n5Factsheet – Access to Internet and freedom to receive and\\nimpart information and ideas\\n(or the ban on prisoners’ telephone and radio communications and implicitly therefore\\nalso Internet) and security considerations.\\nThe Court was not persuaded that sufficient reasons had been put forward by the\\nLithuanian authorities to justify the interference with the applicant’s right to receive\\ninformation which, in the specific circumstances of the case, could not be regarded as\\nhaving been necessary in a democratic society. It therefore held that there had been a\\nviolation of Article 10 of the Convention. The Court noted in particular that Article 10\\ncould not be interpreted as imposing a general obligation to provide access to the\\nInternet, or to specific Internet sites for prisoners. However, since access to information\\nrelating to education was granted under Lithuanian law, the restriction of access to the\\nInternet site in question had constituted an interference with the applicant’s right to\\nreceive information. That interference was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate\\naim of protecting the rights of others and preventing disorder and crime. However, the\\nwebsite to which the applicant wished to have access contained information about\\nlearning and study programmes in Lithuania, and it was not unreasonable to hold that\\nsuch information was directly relevant to the applicant’s interest in obtaining education,\\nwhich was in turn relevant for his rehabilitation and subsequent reintegration into\\nsociety. The Court also observed that the Internet played an important role in people’s\\neveryday lives, in particular since certain information was exclusively available on the\\nInternet. The Lithuanian authorities had however not considered the possibility of\\ngranting the applicant limited or controlled Internet access to that particular website\\nadministered by a State institution, which could hardly have posed a security risk.\\nMehmet Reşit Arslan and Orhan Bingöl v. Turkey\\n18 June 2019 (judgment)\\nThe applicants, who were convicted in 1992 and 1995, respectively, for membership of\\nan illegal armed organisation and were both serving sentences of life imprisonment,\\ncomplained in particular of being prevented from using a computer and accessing the\\nInternet. They submitted that these resources were essential in order for them to\\ncontinue their higher education and improve their general knowledge. They had appealed\\nto the courts but had been unsuccessful.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 2 (right to education) of\\nProtocol No. 1 to the Convention in respect of both applicants. It was not persuaded by\\nthe grounds put forward to justify the Turkish authorities’ denial of the requests by the\\napplicants to use audio-visual materials and computers and to have Internet access, and\\nfound that the domestic courts had failed to strike a fair balance between their right to\\neducation on the one hand and the imperatives of public order on the other. The Court\\nreiterated in particular that the importance of education in prison had been\\nacknowledged by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in its recommendations\\non education in prison and in its European Prison Rules.\\nFurther reading\\nSee in particular:\\n- Council of Europe web page on “Internet Users Rights”\\nMedia Contact:\\nTel.: +33 (0)3 90 21 42 08\\n6',\n",
       " 'Factsheet – Protection of journalistic sources\\nJanuary 2024\\nThis Factsheet does not bind the Court and is not exhaustive\\nProtection of journalistic sources\\nArticle 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on\\nHuman Rights\\nThe European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly emphasised that Article 10 of the\\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights safeguards not only the substance and\\ncontents of information and ideas, but also the means of transmitting it. The press has\\nbeen accorded the broadest scope of protection in the Court’s case law, including with\\nregard to confidentiality of journalistic sources.\\n“Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom. …\\nWithout such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in\\ninforming the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog\\nrole of the press may be undermined, and the ability of the press to provide accurate\\nand reliable information be adversely affected. … [A]n order of source disclosure ...\\ncannot be compatible with Article 10 of the Convention unless it is justified by an\\noverriding requirement in the public interest.” (Goodwin v. the United Kingdom,\\njudgment of 27 March 1996, § 39).\\nJournalists obliged to disclose journalistic sources / Alleged\\nfailure to protect journalistic sources\\nGoodwin v. the United Kingdom\\n27 March 1996\\nThis case concerned a disclosure order imposed on a journalist (working for The\\nEngineer) requiring him to reveal the identity of his source of information on a\\ncompany’s confidential corporate plan.\\nThere was not, in the European Court of Human Rights’ view, a reasonable relationship\\nof proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued by the disclosure order and the\\nmeans deployed to achieve that aim. Both the order requiring the applicant to reveal his\\nsource and the fine imposed upon him for having refused to do so gave rise to a\\nviolation of his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European\\nConvention on Human Rights.\\nNordisk Film & TV A/S v. Denmark\\n8 December 2005 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned an order to disclose research material obtained by a journalist who,\\nmaking a documentary on paedophilia in Denmark, went undercover and became\\ninvolved in a paedophile association.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. It found in\\nparticular that the domestic court’s order had been a proportionate interference with the\\njournalist’s freedom of expression that was justifiable for the prevention of crime,\\nnotably with regard to a serious child abuse case.Factshe et – Protection of journalistic sources\\nVoskuil v. the Netherlands\\n22 November 2007\\nThe applicant, a journalist, was denied the right not to disclose his source for two articles\\nhe had written for a newspaper concerning a criminal investigation into arms trafficking,\\nand detained for more than two weeks in an attempt to compel him to do so.\\nThe Court, finding in particular that the Dutch Government’s interest in knowing the\\nidentity of the applicant’s source had not been sufficient to override the applicant’s\\ninterest in concealing it, held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the\\nConvention. It further held that there had also been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (right\\nto liberty and security) of the Convention in the applicant’s case.\\nFinancial Times Ltd and Others v. the United Kingdom\\n15 December 2009\\nThis case concerned the complaint by four United Kingdom newspapers and a news\\nagency that they had been ordered to disclose documents to Interbrew, a Belgian\\nbrewing company, which could lead to the identification of journalistic sources at the\\norigin of a leak to the press about a takeover bid.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nEmphasising in particular the chilling effect arising whenever journalists were seen to\\nassist in the identification of anonymous sources, it found that the interests in\\neliminating damage through the future dissemination of confidential information and in\\nobtaining damages for past breaches of confidence were, even if considered\\ncumulatively, insufficient to outweigh the public interest in the protection of\\njournalists’ sources.\\nSanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands\\n14 September 2010 (Grand Chamber)\\nThis case concerned photographs, to be used for an article on illegal car racing, which a\\nDutch magazine publishing company was compelled to hand over to police investigating\\nanother crime, despite the journalists’ strong objections to being forced to divulge\\nmaterial capable of identifying confidential sources.\\nThe Court found in particular that the interference with the applicant company’s freedom\\nof expression had not been “prescribed by law”, there having been no procedure with\\nadequate legal safeguards available to the applicant company to enable an independent\\nassessment as to whether the interest of the criminal investigation overrode the public\\ninterest in the protection of journalistic sources. There had therefore been a violation of\\nArticle 10 of the Convention.\\nTelegraaf Media Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands\\n22 November 2012\\nThe applicants – a limited liability company incorporated under Netherlands law,\\npublisher of the mass-circulation daily newspaper De Telegraaf, and two journalists –\\ncomplained about the order to surrender documents which could identify journalistic\\nsources and about the use of special powers by the State.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Articles 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) and 10 of the Convention in respect of the two journalists, finding in\\nparticular that the relevant law in the Netherlands had not provided appropriate\\nsafeguards in respect of the powers of surveillance used against them, with a view to\\ndiscovering their journalistic sources. The Court further held that there had been a\\nviolation of Article 10 as regards the order for the surrender of documents addressed\\nto the publishing company. It restated in particular the importance of journalistic\\nsources’ protection for press freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling\\neffect an order of source disclosure could have on the exercise of that freedom and\\nfound that the need to identify the secret services official(s) who had supplied the secret\\ndocuments to the applicants had not justified the order to surrender documents.\\n2Factshe et – Protection of journalistic sources\\nBecker v. Norway\\n5 October 2017\\nThis case concerned a journalist who was ordered to give evidence in a criminal case\\nbrought against one of her sources, Mr X, for market manipulation. Mr X had confirmed\\nto the police that he had been the applicant’s source for an article she had written in\\n2007 about the Norwegian Oil Company’s allegedly difficult financial situation. He was\\nsubsequently charged with using the applicant to manipulate the financial market. The\\napplicant refused to testify at any stage of the proceedings against Mr X, and the courts\\ntherefore ordered her to testify about her contacts with him, finding that there was no\\nsource to protect as he had already come forward. They also considered that her\\nevidence might significantly assist the courts in elucidating the case. Mr X was however\\nconvicted as charged before the final decision on her duty to give evidence had been\\nmade. The applicant complained about the decision ordering her to give evidence on her\\ncontacts with her source, alleging that this would have most likely lead to other sources\\nbeing identified too. She also argued that, in any case, there had been no real need for\\nher testimony in the case against her source.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nIt found that its assessment turned, above all, on whether the applicant’s evidence had\\nbeen needed during the criminal investigation and subsequent court proceedings against\\nher source. It pointed out that her refusal to disclose her source (or sources) had not at\\nany point in time hindered either the investigation or proceedings against Mr X. Indeed,\\nthe first-instance court which convicted Mr X had been informed by the prosecutor that\\nno motion for extension (pending a final decision on the duty to give evidence) had been\\nmade, because the case had been sufficiently disclosed even without Ms Becker’s\\nstatement. The Court also bore in mind that the applicant’s journalistic methods had\\nnever been called into question and she had not been accused of any illegal activity.\\nFurthermore, her right as a journalist to keep her sources confidential could not\\nautomatically be removed because of a source’s conduct or because the source’s identity\\nhad become known. The Court was not therefore convinced that either the\\ncircumstances in the present case or the reasons provided had justified compelling the\\napplicant to testify.\\nJecker v. Switzerland\\n6 October 2020\\nThe applicant in this case, a journalist, submitted that she had been compelled to give\\nevidence during a criminal investigation into drug trafficking and that the authorities had\\nrequired her to disclose her sources following the publication of a newspaper article\\nabout a soft-drug dealer who had provided her with information. She complained of an\\nunjustified interference with the exercise of her right as a journalist not to disclose\\nher sources.\\nThe European Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the\\nConvention in respect of the applicant. It noted in particular that the Swiss Federal\\nSupreme Court had found that the applicant could not rely on the right to refuse to\\ntestify, since trafficking in soft drugs was an aggravated offence. Referring to the\\nbalance struck in the legislation between the interests at stake, the Federal Supreme\\nCourt had held that the public interest in prosecuting an aggravated drug offence\\noutweighed the interest in protecting a source. The European Court pointed out in its\\njudgment that in view of the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for\\npress freedom in a democratic society, a requirement for a journalist to disclose the\\nidentity of his or her source could not be compatible with Article 10 of the Convention\\nunless it was justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest. In the present\\ncase, it was not sufficient for the interference to have been imposed because the offence\\nin question fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in\\ngeneral terms; instead, it should have been ascertained that it was necessary in the\\nspecific circumstances. However, the Federal Supreme Court had decided the case with\\nreference to the balancing exercise performed in general and abstract terms by the\\n3Factshe et – Protection of journalistic sources\\nlegislature. Its judgment could not therefore lead to the conclusion that the order for the\\napplicant to give evidence had satisfied an overriding requirement in the public interest.\\nAccordingly, the Federal Supreme Court had failed to provide sufficient justification that\\nthe measure complained of had corresponded to a pressing social need, and the\\ninterference with the exercise of the applicant’s freedom of expression could not be\\nregarded as necessary in a democratic society.\\nBig Brother Watch and Others v. the United Kingdom\\n25 May 2021 (Grand Chamber)\\nThese applications were lodged after revelations by Edward Snowden (former contractor\\nwith the US National Security Agency) about programmes of surveillance and intelligence\\nsharing between the USA and the United Kingdom. The case concerned complaints by\\njournalists and human-rights organisations in regard to three different surveillance\\nregimes: (1) the bulk interception of communications; (2) the receipt of intercept\\nmaterial from foreign governments and intelligence agencies; (3) the obtaining of\\ncommunications data from communication service providers1.\\nThe Grand Chamber held: unanimously, that there had been a violation of Article 8\\n(right to respect for private life and correspondence) of the Convention in respect of the\\nbulk intercept regime; unanimously, that there had been a violation of Article 8 in\\nrespect of the regime for obtaining communications data from communication service\\nproviders; by twelve votes to five, that there had been no violation of Article 8 in\\nrespect of the United Kingdom’s regime for requesting intercepted material from foreign\\nGovernments and intelligence agencies; unanimously, that there had been a violation\\nof Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention, concerning both the bulk\\ninterception regime and the regime for obtaining communications data from\\ncommunication service providers; and, by twelve votes to fives, that there had been no\\nviolation of Article 10 in respect of the regime for requesting intercepted material\\nfrom foreign Governments and intelligence agencies. The Court considered in particular\\nthat, owing to the multitude of threats States face in modern society, operating a bulk\\ninterception regime did not in and of itself violate the Convention. However, such a\\nregime had to be subject to “end-to-end safeguards”, meaning that, at the domestic\\nlevel, an assessment should be made at each stage of the process of the necessity and\\nproportionality of the measures being taken; that bulk interception should be subject to\\nindependent authorisation at the outset, when the object and scope of the operation\\nwere being defined; and that the operation should be subject to supervision and\\nindependent ex post facto review. Having regard to the bulk interception regime\\noperated in the UK, the Court identified the following deficiencies: bulk interception had\\nbeen authorised by the Secretary of State, and not by a body independent of the\\nexecutive; categories of search terms defining the kinds of communications that would\\nbecome liable for examination had not been included in the application for a warrant;\\nand search terms linked to an individual (that is to say specific identifiers such as an\\nemail address) had not been subject to prior internal authorisation. The Court also found\\nthat the bulk interception regime had not contained sufficient protections for confidential\\njournalistic material. The regime for obtaining communications data from communication\\nservice providers was also found to have not been in accordance with the law. However,\\nthe Court held that the regime by which the UK could request intelligence from foreign\\ngovernments and/or intelligence agencies had had sufficient safeguards in place to\\nprotect against abuse and to ensure that UK authorities had not used such requests as a\\nmeans of circumventing their duties under domestic law and the Convention.\\n1. At the relevant time, the regime for bulk interception and obtaining communications data from\\ncommunication service providers had a statutory basis in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This\\nhad since been replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. The findings of the Grand Chamber relate solely\\nto the provisions of the 2000 Act, which had been the legal framework in force at the time the events\\ncomplained of had taken place.\\n4Factshe et – Protection of journalistic sources\\nStandard Verlagsgesellschaft mbH v. Austria (No. 3)\\n7 December 2021\\nThis case concerned court orders for the applicant media company to reveal the sign-up\\ninformation of registered users who had posted comments on its website,\\nderStandard.at, the website of the newspaper Der Standard. This had followed\\ncomments allegedly linking politicians to, among other things, corruption or neo-Nazis,\\nwhich the applicant company had removed, albeit refusing to reveal the information of\\nthe commenters.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention\\nin the present case, finding that the court orders in question had not been necessary\\nin a democratic society. The Court found, in particular, that user data did not enjoy the\\nprotection of “journalistic sources”, and there was no absolute right to online anonymity.\\nHowever, the domestic courts had not even balanced the interests of the plaintiffs\\nwith the interests of the applicant company in keeping its users anonymous so as to help\\npromote the free exchange of ideas and information as covered by Article 10 of\\nthe Convention.\\nPending applications\\nAssociation confraternelle de la presse judiciaire v.

Luxembourg\\n25 February 2003\\nThe applicants in this case were a journalist and his lawyer in the domestic proceedings.\\nThe case concerned an unannounced raid and search by the police of the first applicant’s\\nhome following the publication of an article concerning tax fraud by a government\\nminister. Investigators armed with search warrants carried out extensive investigations.\\nThe investigating judge had also ordered a search of the first applicant’s lawyer’s office.\\nConsidering that the Government had not shown that the balance between the interests\\nat stake, namely the protection of sources on the one hand and the prevention and\\npunishment of crime on the other, had been preserved, the Court held that the\\nmeasures in issue had been disproportionate and had infringed the first applicant’s right\\nto freedom of expression. There had therefore been a violation of Article 10 of the\\nConvention in respect of the first applicant. The Court further found that the search\\ncarried out at the first applicant’s lawyer’s office had had repercussions on the first\\napplicant’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention. Holding that the search of the\\nsecond applicant’s office had been disproportionate to the aim pursued, particularly in\\nview of the rapidity with which it had been carried out, the Court accordingly concluded\\nthat there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for home) of the\\nConvention in respect of the second applicant.\\nErnst and Others v. Belgium\\n15 July 2003\\nThe applicants in this case were four journalists.

In this case the Court\\nfurther held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private life),\\nno violation of Article 6 § 1 (right to a fair hearing), no violation of Article 14 (prohibition\\nof discrimination) taken together with Article 6 § 1 and no violation of Article 13 (right to\\nan effective remedy) of the Convention.\\nTillack v.

It found the reasons given by the Belgian courts to justify the searches\\ninsufficient.\\nMartin and Others v.

The reasons given by the authorities\\n6Factshe et – Protection of journalistic sources\\nto justify the search could be considered relevant, but not sufficient. The search had\\naccordingly been disproportionate.\\nRessiot and Others v.

The authorities wanted to identify the source of the leaks in an\\ninvestigation into possible doping in cycle racing.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nIt found in particular that the French Government had not shown that a fair balance had\\nbeen struck between the various interests involved. The measures taken had not been\\nreasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, having regard to the interest of\\na democratic society in ensuring and maintaining the freedom of the press.\\nSaint-Paul Luxembourg S.A. v. Luxembourg\\n18 April 2013\\nThis case concerned a search and seizure warrant issued by an investigating\\njudge against a newspaper after the latter had published an article which was the\\nsubject of a complaint to the judicial authorities by an individual mentioned in the article\\nand his employer.\\nThe Court found a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private life) and a\\nviolation of Article 10 of the Convention. It held in particular that the search and\\nseizure warrant had not been reasonably proportionate to the aim pursued, namely to\\nverify the identity of the journalist who had written the article, and that it had been\\ninsufficiently limited in scope to prevent possible abuse by the investigating officers, for\\ninstance in the form of attempts to identify the journalist’s sources.\\nNagla v. Latvia\\n16 July 2013\\nThis case concerned the search by the police of a well-known broadcast journalist’s\\nhome, and their seizure of data storage devices. Her home was searched following a\\nbroadcast she had aired in February 2010 informing the public of an information leak\\nfrom the State Revenue Service database.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nIt emphasised in particular that the right of journalist’s not to disclose their sources\\ncould not be considered a privilege, dependent on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their\\nsources, but rather as an intrinsic part of the right to information that should be treated\\nwith the utmost caution. In this case the investigating authorities had failed to properly\\nbalance the interest of the investigation in securing evidence against the public interest\\nin protecting the journalist’s freedom of expression.\\nStichting Ostade Blade v. the Netherlands\\n27 May 2014 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the search of a magazine’s premises following a press release it\\nissued announcing that it had received a letter from an organisation claiming\\nresponsibility for a series of bomb attacks in Arnhem. The publisher of the magazine\\ncomplained in particular that the search had amounted to a violation of its right to\\nprotect its journalistic sources.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. It concluded\\nthat “source protection” was not in issue in this case as the magazine’s informant, who\\nwas seeking publicity for the attacks under cover of the press, was not entitled to the\\nsame protection as ordinarily accorded to “sources”. The search, which had been carried\\nout in order to investigate a serious crime and prevent further attacks, had therefore\\ncomplied with the requirements under Article 10 of the Convention, notably of being\\nnecessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime.\\n7Factshe et – Protection of journalistic sources\\nGörmüş and Others v. Turkey\\n19 January 2016\\nIn April 2007 the Nokta weekly magazine published an article based on documents\\nclassified “confidential” by the Chief of Staff of the armed forces. The applicants –\\nrespectively, at the relevant time, the publishing director and editors-in-chief of the\\nweekly magazine as well as investigative journalists who worked for the publication –\\ncomplained that the measures taken by the relevant authorities, particularly the search\\nof their professional premises and the seizure of their documents, had been intended to\\nidentify their sources of information and infringed their right to freedom of expression,\\nespecially their right to receive or impart information as journalists.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nIt found in particular that the article published by the weekly newspaper Nokta, on the\\nbasis of “confidential” military documents about a system for classifying the media on\\nthe basis of whether they were “favourable” or “unfavourable” to the armed forces, was\\ncapable of contributing to public debate. Emphasising the importance of freedom of\\nexpression with regard to matters of public interest and the need to protect journalistic\\nsources, including when those sources were State officials highlighting unsatisfactory\\npractices in their workplace, the Court held that the interference with the journalists’\\nright to freedom of expression, especially their right to impart information, had not been\\nproportionate to the legitimate aim sought, had not met a pressing social need, and had\\nnot therefore been necessary in a democratic society; the interference had consisted in\\nthe seizure, retrieval and storage by the authorities of all of the magazine’s computer\\ndata, even data that was unrelated to the article, with a view to identifying the public-\\nsector whistle-blowers. Lastly, the Court considered that this measure was such as to\\ndeter potential sources from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of\\ngeneral interest, including when they concerned the armed forces.\\nSedletska v. Ukraine\\n1 April 2021\\nThis case concerned judicial authorisation of the accessing of the phone data of the\\napplicant, a journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, by the investigating\\nauthorities, which had threatened the protection of her journalistic sources.\\nThe applicant complained, of an unjustified interference with the right to protection of\\njournalistic sources.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention\\nin respect of the applicant. In view of its findings in the case, it was not convinced that\\nthe data access authorisation given by the domestic courts had been justified by\\nan “overriding requirement in the public interest” and, therefore, necessary in a\\ndemocratic society.\\nSergey Sorokin v.

The applicant complained about the search of his flat and the\\nseizure of his computer, hard drives and an audio cassette in this context. He also\\nalleged that the subsequent judicial review of the measures against him had failed to\\nbalance protection of journalistic sources against the needs of the criminal investigation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the impugned search had been carried out in the absence of procedural safeguards\\nagainst interference with the confidentiality of the applicant’s journalistic sources\\nand had therefore not been “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve the legitimate\\naim pursued, namely preventing crime.\\n2.

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 [of the European Convention on Human\\nRights], it is applicable not only to ‘information’ or ‘ideas’ that are favourably\\nreceived or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to\\nthose that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population.\\nSuch are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which\\nthere is no ‘democratic society’. This means, amongst other things, that every\\n‘formality’, ‘condition’, ‘restriction’ or ‘penalty’ imposed in this sphere must be\\nproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.” (Handyside v. the United Kingdom\\njudgment of 7 December 1976, § 49).\\n“… [T]olerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human beings constitute the\\nfoundations of a democratic, pluralistic society. That being so, as a matter of principle it\\nmay be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even\\nprevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred\\nbased on intolerance …, provided that any ‘formalities’, ‘conditions’, ‘restrictions’ or\\n‘penalties’ imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.” (Erbakan v. Turkey\\njudgment of 6 July 2006, § 56).\\n1. When dealing with cases concerning incitement to hatred and freedom of expression,\\nthe European Court of Human Rights uses two approaches which are provided for by the\\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights:\\n- the approach of exclusion from the protection of the Convention, provided for by\\nArticle 17 (prohibition of abuse of rights)1, where the comments in question amount to\\nhate speech and negate the fundamental values of the Convention; and\\n- the approach of setting restrictions on protection, provided for by Article 10,\\nparagraph 2, of the Convention2 (this approach is adopted where the speech in question,\\nalthough it is hate speech, is not apt to destroy the fundamental values of the\\nConvention).\\n2. Internet news portals which, for commercial and professional purposes, provide a\\nplatform for user-generated comments assume the “duties and responsibilities”\\nassociated with freedom of expression in accordance with Article 10 § 2 of the\\nConvention where users disseminate hate speech or comments amounting to direct\\nincitement to violence.\\n1 This provision is aimed at preventing persons from inferring from the Convention any right to engage in\\nactivities or perform acts aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth in the\\nConvention.\\n2 Restrictions deemed necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder\\nor crime, the protection of health or morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.Factshe et – Hate speech\\nExclusion from the protection of the Convention\\n“[T]here is no doubt that any remark directed against the Convention’s underlying\\nvalues would be removed from the protection of Article 10 [freedom of expression] by\\nArticle 17 [prohibition of abuse of rights] (…)” (Seurot v.

He argued that his right to freedom of expression\\nhad been infringed.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible (incompatible ratione materiae).\\nIt considered that the content of the applicant’s remarks had amounted to Holocaust\\ndenial, and pointed out that denying crimes against humanity was one of the most\\nserious forms of racial defamation of Jews and of incitement to hatred of them. Disputing\\nthe existence of clearly established historical events did not constitute scientific or\\nhistorical research; the real purpose was to rehabilitate the National Socialist regime and\\naccuse the victims themselves of falsifying history. As such acts were manifestly\\nincompatible with the fundamental values which the Convention sought to promote, the\\nCourt applied Article 17 (prohibition of abuse of rights) and held that the applicant was\\nnot entitled to rely on Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention.\\n3.

France\\n20 October 2015 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the conviction of Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala, a comedian with political\\nactivities, for public insults directed at a person or group of persons on account of their\\norigin or of belonging to a given ethnic community, nation, race or religion, specifically in\\nthis case persons of Jewish origin or faith. At the end of a show in December 2008 at the\\n“Zénith” in Paris, the applicant invited Robert Faurisson, an academic who has received a\\nnumber of convictions in France for his negationist and revisionist opinions, mainly his\\ndenial of the existence of gas chambers in concentration camps, to join him on stage to\\nreceive a “prize for unfrequentability and insolence”. The prize, which took the form of a\\nthree-branched candlestick with an apple on each branch, was awarded to him by an\\nactor wearing what was described as a “garment of light” – a pair of striped pyjamas\\nwith a stitched-on yellow star bearing the word “Jew” – who thus played the part of a\\nJewish deportee in a concentration camp.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible (incompatible ratione materiae),\\nin accordance with Article 35 (admissibility criteria) of the Convention, finding that under\\nArticle 17 (prohibition of abuse of rights), the applicant was not entitled to the protection\\nof Article 10 (freedom of expression). The Court considered in particular that during\\nthe offending scene the performance could no longer be seen as entertainment but\\nrather resembled a political meeting, which, under the pretext of comedy, promoted\\nnegationism through the key position given to Robert Faurisson’s appearance and the\\ndegrading portrayal of Jewish deportation victims faced with a man who denied their\\nextermination. In the Court’s view, this was not a performance which, even if satirical or\\nprovocative, fell within the protection of Article 10, but was in reality, in the\\ncircumstances of the case, a demonstration of hatred and anti-Semitism and support for\\nHolocaust denial. Disguised as an artistic production, it was in fact as dangerous as a\\nhead-on and sudden attack, and provided a platform for an ideology which ran counter\\nto the values of the European Convention. The Court thus concluded that the applicant\\nhad sought to deflect Article 10 from its real purpose by using his right to freedom\\nof expression for ends which were incompatible with the letter and spirit of\\nthe Convention and which, if admitted, would contribute to the destruction of Convention\\nrights and freedoms.\\nWilliamson v. Germany\\n8 January 2019 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicant, a bishop and a former member of the Society of Saint Pius X, complained\\nabout his criminal conviction of incitement to hatred for denying the Holocaust on\\nSwedish TV. In particular, he argued that German law was not applicable to his\\nstatements as the offence had not been committed in Germany, but in Sweden – where\\nthat statement was not subject to criminal liability. Moreover, he had never intended\\nthat his statement be broadcast in Germany and had done everything in his power to\\nprevent its broadcast there.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.\\nIt observed in particular that the applicant had agreed to provide the interview, in which\\nhe denied the Holocaust, in Germany despite residing elsewhere at the time while\\nknowing that the statements he made were subject to criminal liability there. He did not\\ninsist during the interview that it not be broadcast in Germany and did not clarify with\\nthe interviewer or the television channel how the interview would be published. The\\n5. See footnote 3 above.\\n3Factshe et – Hate speech\\nCourt thus found that the Regional court’s assessment of the facts was acceptable with\\nrespect to its finding that the offence had been committed in Germany, in particular\\nbecause the key feature of the offence (the interview) had been carried out there.\\nPastörs v. Germany\\n3 October 2019\\nThis case concerned the conviction of a Land deputy for denying the Holocaust during a\\nspeech in the regional Parliament.\\nThe Court declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded the applicant’s\\ncomplaint under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention. It noted in\\nparticular that the applicant had intentionally stated untruths to defame Jews.\\nSuch statements could not attract the protection for freedom of speech offered by the\\nConvention as they ran counter to the values of the Convention itself. In the applicant’s\\ncase, the response by the German courts, the conviction, had therefore been\\nproportionate to the aim pursued and had been “necessary in a democratic society”.\\nReligious hate\\nNorwood v. the United Kingdom\\n16 November 2004 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicant had displayed in his window a poster supplied by the British National Party,\\nof which he was a member, representing the Twin Towers in flame. The picture was\\naccompanied by the words “Islam out of Britain – Protect the British People”. As a result,\\nhe was convicted of aggravated hostility towards a religious group. The applicant argued,\\namong other things, that his right to freedom of expression had been breached.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible (incompatible ratione materiae).\\nIt found in particular that such a general, vehement attack against a religious group,\\nlinking the group as a whole with a grave act of terrorism, was incompatible with the\\nvalues proclaimed and guaranteed by the Convention, notably tolerance, social peace\\nand non-discrimination. The Court therefore held that the applicant\\'s display of the\\nposter in his window had constituted an act within the meaning of Article 17 (prohibition\\nof abuse of rights) of the Convention, and that the applicant could thus not claim the\\nprotection of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention.\\nBelkacem v. Belgium\\n27 June 2017 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, the leader and spokesperson of the\\norganisation “Sharia4Belgium”, which was dissolved in 2012, for incitement to\\ndiscrimination, hatred and violence on account of remarks he made in YouTube videos\\nconcerning non-Muslim groups and Sharia. The applicant argued that he had never\\nintended to incite others to hatred, violence or discrimination but had simply sought to\\npropagate his ideas and opinions. He maintained that his remarks had merely been a\\nmanifestation of his freedom of expression and religion and had not been apt to\\nconstitute a threat to public order.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible (incompatible ratione materiae).\\nIt noted in particular that in his remarks the applicant had called on viewers to\\noverpower non-Muslims, teach them a lesson and fight them. The Court considered that\\nthe remarks in question had a markedly hateful content and that he applicant, through\\nhis recordings, had sought to stir up hatred, discrimination and violence towards all non-\\nMuslims. In the Court’s view, such a general and vehement attack was incompatible with\\nthe values of tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination underlying the European\\nConvention on Human Rights. With reference to the applicant’s remarks concerning\\nSharia, the Court further observed that it had previously ruled that defending Sharia\\nwhile calling for violence to establish it could be regarded as hate speech, and that each\\nContracting State was entitled to oppose political movements based on religious\\nfundamentalism. In the present case, the Court considered that the applicant had\\nattempted to deflect Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention from its real\\n4Factshe et – Hate speech\\npurpose by using his right to freedom of expression for ends which were manifestly\\ncontrary to the spirit of the Convention. Accordingly, the Court held that, in accordance\\nwith Article 17 (prohibition of abuse of rights) of the Convention, the applicant could not\\nclaim the protection of Article 10.\\nEthnic hate\\nPavel Ivanov v. Russia6\\n20 February 2007 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicant, owner and editor of a newspaper, was convicted of public incitement to\\nethnic, racial and religious hatred through the use of mass-media. He authored and\\npublished a series of articles portraying the Jews as the source of evil in Russia, calling\\nfor their exclusion from social life. He accused an entire ethnic group of plotting a\\nconspiracy against the Russian people and ascribed Fascist ideology to the Jewish\\nleadership. Both in his publications, and in his oral submissions at the trial, he\\nconsistently denied the Jews the right to national dignity, claiming that they did not form\\na nation. The applicant complained, in particular, that his conviction for incitement to\\nracial hatred had not been justified.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible (incompatible ratione materiae). It had\\nno doubt as to the markedly anti-Semitic tenor of the applicant’s views and agreed with\\nthe assessment made by the domestic courts that through his publications he had\\nsought to incite hatred towards the Jewish people. Such a general, vehement attack on\\none ethnic group is directed against the Convention’s underlying values, notably\\ntolerance, social peace and non-discrimination. Consequently, by reason of Article 17\\n(prohibition of abuse of rights) of the Convention, the applicant could not benefit from\\nthe protection afforded by Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention.\\nSee also: W.P. and Others v. Poland (no. 42264/98), decision on the admissibility of\\n2 September 2004 (concerning the refusal by the Polish authorities to allow the creation\\nof an association with statutes including anti-Semitic statements – the Court held that\\nthe applicants could not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 11 (freedom of\\nassembly and association) of the Convention).\\nIncitement to violence and support for terrorist activity\\nRoj TV A/S v. Denmark\\n17 April 2018 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the applicant company’s conviction for terrorism offences by Danish\\ncourts for promoting the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) through television programmes\\nbroadcast between 2006 and 2010. The domestic courts found it established that the\\nPKK could be considered a terrorist organisation within the meaning of the Danish Penal\\nCode and that Roj TV A/S had supported the PKK’s terror operation by broadcasting\\npropaganda. It was fined and its licence was withdrawn. The applicant company\\ncomplained that its conviction had interfered with its freedom of expression.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being incompatible ratione materiae\\nwith the provisions of the Convention. It found in particular that the television station\\ncould not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention as it had\\ntried to employ that right for ends which were contrary to the values of the Convention.\\nThat had included incitement to violence and support for terrorist activity, which had\\nbeen in violation of Article 17 (prohibition of abuse of rights) of the Convention. Thus the\\ncomplaint by the applicant company did not attract the protection of the right to freedom\\nof expression.\\n6. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the European Convention on Human\\nRights (“the Convention”).\\n5Factshe et – Hate speech\\nIncitement to violence or hatred against people because of\\ntheir sexual orientation\\nLenis v. Greece\\n27 June 2023 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the posting by the applicant – who was the Metropolitan (equivalent\\nof a bishop) of the Greek Orthodox Church for Kalavryta and Aigialeia at the time of the\\nevents – of a homophobic article on his personal blog in December 2015, when the\\nGreek Parliament had been about to debate proposed legislation introducing civil unions\\nfor same-sex couples, and his subsequent prosecution and sentencing for incitement to\\nhatred and discrimination.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being incompatible ratione materiae\\nwith the provisions of the Convention. In the present case, it noted in particular that the\\napplicant’s right to freedom of expression as protected by the Convention had not been\\nviolated, as his views had been liable to cause discrimination and hatred. Moreover, even\\nthough criticism of certain lifestyles on moral or religious grounds was not in itself\\nexempt from protection under Article 10 of the Convention, when remarks went so far as\\nto deny LGBTI people their human nature, and were coupled with incitement to violence,\\nthen the engagement of Article 17 (prohibition of abuse of rights) of the Convention had\\nto be considered. Considering the nature and wording of the statements in the impugned\\narticle, the context in which they had been published, their potential to lead to harmful\\nconsequences and the reasons found by the Greek courts, which had carefully assessed\\nthe evidence before them and had conducted a balancing exercise which had taken into\\naccount the applicant’s right to freedom of expression, the Court found that the\\nstatements sought to deflect Article 10 of the Convention from its real purpose. In\\naddition, the remarks related directly to an issue which was of high importance in\\nmodern European society – protection of people’s dignity and human value irrespective\\nof their sexual orientation.\\nRestrictions on the protection afforded by Article 10 (freedom\\nof expression) of the Convention\\nUnder Article 10, paragraph 2, of the Convention, the Court will examine successively\\nif an interference in the freedom of expression exists, if this interference is prescribed\\nby law and pursues one or more legitimate aims, and, finally, if it is “necessary in a\\ndemocratic society” to achieve these aims.\\nIncitement to racial or religious discrimination or hatred\\nJersild v. Denmark\\n23 September 1994\\nThe applicant, a journalist, had made a documentary containing extracts from a\\ntelevision interview he had conducted with three members of a group of young people\\ncalling themselves the “Greenjackets”, who had made abusive and derogatory remarks\\nabout immigrants and ethnic groups in Denmark. The applicant was convicted of aiding\\nand abetting the dissemination of racist remarks. He alleged a breach of his right to\\nfreedom of expression.\\nThe Court drew a distinction between the members of the “Greenjackets”, who had\\nmade openly racist remarks, and the applicant, who had sought to expose, analyse and\\nexplain this particular group of youths and to deal with “specific aspects of a matter that\\nalready then was of great public concern”. The documentary as a whole had not been\\naimed at propagating racist views and ideas, but at informing the public about a social\\nissue. Accordingly, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10\\n(freedom of expression) of the Convention.\\n6Factshe et – Hate speech\\nSoulas and Others v. France\\n10 July 2008\\nThis case concerned criminal proceedings brought against the applicants, following the\\npublication of a book entitled \"The colonisation of Europe”, with the subtitle “Truthful\\nremarks about immigration and Islam”. The proceedings resulted in their conviction\\nfor inciting hatred and violence against Muslim communities from northern and\\ncentral Africa. The applicants complained in particular that their freedom of expression\\nhad been breached.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It noted, in particular, that, when convicting the applicants, the\\ndomestic courts had underlined that the terms used in the book were intended to give\\nrise in readers to a feeling of rejection and antagonism, exacerbated by the use of\\nmilitary language, with regard to the communities in question, which were designated as\\nthe main enemy, and to lead the book’s readers to share the solution recommended by\\nthe author, namely a war of ethnic re-conquest. Holding that the grounds put forward in\\nsupport of the applicants’ conviction had been sufficient and relevant, it considered that\\nthe interference in the latter’s right to freedom of expression had been “necessary in a\\ndemocratic society”. Finally, the Court observed that the disputed passages in the book\\nwere not sufficiently serious to justify the application of Article 17 (prohibition of abuse\\nof rights) of the Convention in the applicants’ case.\\nFéret v. Belgium\\n16 July 2009\\nThe applicant was a Belgian member of Parliament and chairman of the political party\\nFront National/Nationaal Front in Belgium. During the election campaign, several types\\nof leaflets were distributed carrying slogans including “Stand up against the\\nIslamification of Belgium”, “Stop the sham integration policy” and “Send non-European\\njob-seekers home”. The applicant was convicted of incitement to racial discrimination.\\nHe was sentenced to community service and was disqualified from holding parliamentary\\noffice for 10 years. He alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. In its view, the applicant’s comments had clearly been liable\\nto arouse feelings of distrust, rejection or even hatred towards foreigners, especially\\namong less knowledgeable members of the public. His message, conveyed in an\\nelectoral context, had carried heightened resonance and clearly amounted to incitement\\nto racial hatred. The applicant’s conviction had been justified in the interests\\nof preventing disorder and protecting the rights of others, namely members of the\\nimmigrant community.\\nLe Pen v. France\\n20 April 2010 (decision on the admissibility)\\nAt the time of the facts, the applicant was president of the French “National Front” party.\\nHe alleged in particular that his conviction for incitement to discrimination, hatred and\\nviolence towards a group of people because of their origin or their membership or non-\\nmembership of a specific ethnic group, nation, race or religion, on account of statements\\nhe had made about Muslims in France in an interview with Le Monde daily newspaper –\\nhe had asserted, among other things, that “the day there are no longer 5 million but\\n25 million Muslims in France, they will be in charge” – had breached his right to freedom\\nof expression.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.\\nIt observed that the applicant’s statements had been made in the context of a general\\ndebate on the problems linked to the settlement and integration of immigrants in their\\nhost countries. Moreover, the varying scale of the problems concerned, which could\\nsometimes generate misunderstanding and incomprehension, required considerable\\nlatitude to be left to the State in assessing the need for interference with a person’s\\nfreedom of expression. In this case, however, the applicant’s comments had certainly\\n7Factshe et – Hate speech\\npresented the Muslim community as a whole in a disturbing light likely to give rise to\\nfeelings of rejection and hostility. He had set the French on the one hand against a\\ncommunity whose religious convictions were explicitly mentioned and whose rapid\\ngrowth was presented as an already latent threat to the dignity and security of the\\nFrench people. The reasons given by the domestic courts for convicting the applicant had\\nthus been relevant and sufficient. Nor had the penalty imposed been disproportionate.\\nThe Court therefore found that the interference with the applicant’s enjoyment of his\\nright to freedom of expression had been “necessary in a democratic society”.\\nPerinçek v. Switzerland\\n15 October 2015 (Grand Chamber)\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant, a Turkish politician, for\\npublicly expressing the view, in Switzerland, that the mass deportations and massacres\\nsuffered by the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and the following years had\\nnot amounted to genocide. The Swiss courts held in particular that his motives appeared\\nto be racist and nationalistic and that his statements did not contribute to the historical\\ndebate. The applicant complained that his criminal conviction and punishment had been\\nin breach of his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. Being aware of the great importance attributed by the Armenian\\ncommunity to the question whether those mass deportations and massacres were to be\\nregarded as genocide, it found that the dignity of the victims and the dignity and identity\\nof modern-day Armenians were protected by Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of\\nthe Convention. The Court therefore had to strike a balance between two Convention\\nrights – the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life –,\\ntaking into account the specific circumstances of the case and the proportionality\\nbetween the means used and the aim sought to be achieved. In this case, the Court\\nconcluded that it had not been necessary, in a democratic society, to subject the\\napplicant to a criminal penalty in order to protect the rights of the Armenian community\\nat stake in the case. In particular, the Court took into account the following elements:\\nthe applicant’s statements bore on a matter of public interest and did not amount to a\\ncall for hatred or intolerance; the context in which they were made had not been marked\\nby heightened tensions or special historical overtones in Switzerland; the statements\\ncould not be regarded as affecting the dignity of the members of the Armenian\\ncommunity to the point of requiring a criminal law response in Switzerland; there was no\\ninternational law obligation for Switzerland to criminalise such statements; the Swiss\\ncourts appeared to have censured the applicant simply for voicing an opinion that\\ndiverged from the established ones in Switzerland; and the interference with his right to\\nfreedom of expression had taken the serious form of a criminal conviction.\\nŠimunić v. Croatia\\n22 January 2019 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicant, a football player, was convicted of a minor offence of addressing\\nmessages to spectators of a football match, the content of which expressed or enticed\\nhatred on the basis of race, nationality and faith. He submitted in particular that his right\\nto freedom of expression had been violated.\\nThe Court declared the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, finding that the\\ninterference with his right to freedom of expression had been supported by relevant and\\nsufficient reasons and that the Croatian authorities, having had regard to the relatively\\nmodest nature of the fine imposed on the applicant and the context in which he had\\nshouted the impugned phrase, had struck a fair balance between his interest in free\\nspeech, on the one hand, and society’s interests in promoting tolerance and mutual\\nrespect at sports events as well as combating discrimination through sport on the other\\nhand, thus acting within their margin of appreciation. The Court noted in particular that\\nthe applicant, being a famous football player and a role-model for many football fans,\\n8Factshe et – Hate speech\\nshould have been aware of the possible negative impact of provocative chanting on\\nspectators’ behaviour, and should have abstained from such conduct.\\nZemmour v. France\\n20 December 2022\\nThe case concerned the conviction and sentencing of the applicant – a well known\\npolitical journalist and pundit, who published several books on politics before launching\\nhis own political career in 2021 – for the offence of inciting discrimination and religious\\nhatred against the French Muslim community for statements made on a television show\\nin 2016. He alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in respect of the applicant, finding that the interference with the\\napplicant’s right to freedom of expression had been necessary in a democratic society to\\nprotect the rights of others which had been at stake in the case. While dismissing the\\nFrench Government’s preliminary objection under Article 17 (prohibition of abuse of\\nrights) of the Convention, it relied on that provision as an aid to interpreting Article 10\\nfor the purposes of assessing whether the interference complained of had been\\nnecessary. Like the domestic courts, the Court pointed out in particular that the\\napplicant’s statements had contained derogatory and discriminatory claims of a kind that\\nmight exacerbate a rift between French people and the Muslim community as a whole.\\nIt took the view that the statements in issue had not belonged to a category of speech\\nenjoying enhanced protection under Article 10 and concluded that the French authorities\\nhad therefore had a wide margin of appreciation to impose restrictions. The Court also\\nnoted that the statements had been made on live, prime-time television and observed\\nthat the applicant, who was a journalist and pundit, had not been exempt, although he\\nhad been speaking as an author at the time, from the “duties and responsibilities” of a\\njournalist. The Court was of the opinion that his remarks had not been confined to\\ncriticism of Islam but had, in view of the context of terrorist violence in which they had\\noccurred, been made with discriminatory intent such as to call on viewers to reject and\\nexclude the Muslim community. It concluded that the grounds on which the domestic\\ncourts had convicted the applicant and sentenced him to a fine, the amount of which was\\nnot excessive, had been sufficient and relevant.\\nSee also, recently: de Lesquen du Plessis Casso v. France, decision (Committee) on\\nthe admissibility of 15 December 2022; Société d’exploitation d’un service\\nd’information CNews v. France, decision on the admissibility of 7 November 2023.\\nCondoning war crimes\\nLehideux and Isorni v. France\\n23 September 1998\\nThe applicants wrote a text which was published in the daily newspaper Le Monde and\\nwhich portrayed Marshal Pétain in a favourable light, drawing a veil over his policy of\\ncollaboration with the Nazi regime. The text ended with an invitation to write to two\\nassociations dedicated to defending Marshal Pétain’s memory, seeking to have his case\\nreopened and to have the judgment of 1945 sentencing him to death and to forfeiture of\\nhis civic rights overturned, and to have him rehabilitated. Following a complaint by the\\nNational Association of Former Members of the Resistance, the two authors were\\nconvicted of publicly defending war crimes and crimes of collaboration with the enemy.\\nThey alleged a violation of their right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It considered that the impugned text, although it could be regarded as\\npolemical, could not be said to be negationist since the authors had not been writing in a\\npersonal capacity but on behalf of two legally constituted associations, and had praised\\nnot so much pro-Nazi policies as a particular individual. Lastly, the Court noted that the\\nevents referred to in the text had occurred more than forty years before its publication\\n9Factshe et – Hate speech\\nand that the lapse of time made it inappropriate to deal with such remarks, forty years\\non, with the same severity as ten or twenty years previously.\\nApology of violence and incitement to hostility\\nSürek (no.1) v. Turkey\\n8 July 1999 (Grand Chamber)\\nThe applicant was the owner of a weekly review which published two readers’ letters\\nvehemently condemning the military actions of the authorities in south-east Turkey and\\naccusing them of brutal suppression of the Kurdish people in their struggle for\\nindependence and freedom. The applicant was convicted of “disseminating propaganda\\nagainst the indivisibility of the State and provoking enmity and hatred among the\\npeople”. He complained that his right to freedom of expression had been breached.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression).\\nIt noted that the impugned letters amounted to an appeal to bloody revenge and that\\none of them had identified persons by name, stirred up hatred for them and exposed\\nthem to the possible risk of physical violence. Although the applicant had not personally\\nassociated himself with the views contained in the letters, he had nevertheless provided\\ntheir writers with an outlet for stirring up violence and hatred. The Court considered\\nthat, as the owner of the review, he had been vicariously subject to the duties and\\nresponsibilities which the review’s editorial and journalistic staff undertook in the\\ncollection and dissemination of information to the public, and which assumed even\\ngreater importance in situations of conflict and tension.\\nSee also, among others: Özgür Gündem v.

Turkey\\n13 November 2003 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicant, the leader of an Islamic sect, had been convicted of incitement to commit\\nan offence and incitement to religious hatred on account of statements reported in the\\npress. He was sentenced to four years and two months’ imprisonment and to a fine.\\nThe applicant argued, among other things, that his right to freedom of expression\\nhad been breached.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, finding\\nthat the severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant could not be regarded as\\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the prevention of public\\nincitement to commit offences. The Court stressed in particular that statements which\\nmay be held to amount to hate speech or to glorification of or incitement to violence,\\nsuch as those made in the instant case, cannot be regarded as compatible with\\nthe notion of tolerance and run counter to the fundamental values of justice and peace\\nset forth in the Preamble to the Convention. Admittedly, the applicant\\'s sentence, which\\nwas increased because the offence had been committed by means of mass\\ncommunication, was severe. The Court considered, however, that provision for deterrent\\npenalties in domestic law may be necessary where conduct reaches the level observed in\\nthe instant case and becomes intolerable in that it negates the founding principles of a\\npluralist democracy.\\nGündüz v. Turkey\\n4 December 2003\\nThe applicant was a self-proclaimed member of an Islamist sect. During a televised\\ndebate broadcast in the late evening, he spoke very critically of democracy, describing\\n10Factshe et – Hate speech\\ncontemporary secular institutions as “impious”, fiercely criticising secular and democratic\\nprinciples and openly calling for the introduction of Sharia law. He was convicted of\\nopenly inciting the population to hatred and hostility on the basis of a distinction founded\\non membership of a religion or denomination. The applicant alleged a violation of his\\nright to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It noted in particular that the applicant, who had represented the\\nextremist ideas of his sect, with which the public was already familiar, had been taking\\nan active part in an animated public discussion. That pluralist debate had sought to\\npresent the sect and its unorthodox views, including the notion that democratic values\\nwere incompatible with its conception of Islam. The topic had been the subject of\\nwidespread debate in the Turkish media and concerned a problem of general interest.\\nThe Court considered that the applicant’s remarks could not be regarded as a call to\\nviolence or as hate speech based on religious intolerance. The mere fact of defending\\nsharia, without calling for violence to introduce it, could not be regarded as hate speech.\\nSee also: Fondation Zehra and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 10 July 2018\\n(concerning the dissolution of a foundation striving for a State based on Sharia; the\\nCourt found that the dissolution was justified and held that there had been no violation\\nof Article 11 (freedom of association) of the Convention in the case).\\nFaruk Temel v. Turkey\\n1 February 2011\\nThe applicant, the chairman of a legal political party, read out a statement to the press\\nat a meeting of the party, in which he criticised the United States’ intervention in Iraq\\nand the solitary confinement of the leader of a terrorist organisation. He also criticised\\nthe disappearance of persons taken into police custody. Following his speech the\\napplicant was convicted of disseminating propaganda, on the ground that he had publicly\\ndefended the use of violence or other terrorist methods. The applicant contended that\\nhis right to freedom of expression had been breached.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It noted in particular that the applicant had been speaking as a political\\nactor and a member of an opposition political party, presenting his party’s views on\\ntopical matters of general interest. It took the view that his speech, taken overall, had\\nnot incited others to the use of violence, armed resistance or uprising and had not\\namounted to hate speech.\\nSee also, among others: Dicle (no. 2) v.

Turkey\\n10 March 2020\\nThis case concerned a judicial fine imposed on the applicant for an article published in\\n2007 in his periodical Tokat Demokrat, describing the perpetrators of the “Kızıldere\\nevents”, among others as “idols of the youth”. The events in question took place in\\nMarch 1972, when three British nationals working for NATO were abducted and executed\\nby their kidnappers. The applicant was convicted in 2008 by the Criminal Court, which\\nfound that the article glorified the insurgents involved in those events. He complained in\\nparticular of a breach of his freedom of expression on account of his criminal conviction\\nand sentence to a judicial fine.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of\\nexpression had not been disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. It took the\\n11Factshe et – Hate speech\\nview, in particular, that the expressions used in the article, about the perpetrators of the\\n“Kızıldere events” and their acts, could be seen as glorifying, or at least as justifying,\\nviolence. It took account of the margin of appreciation afforded to national authorities in\\nsuch cases and the reasonable amount of the fine imposed on the applicant.\\nFurthermore, it was important not to minimise the risk that such writings might\\nencourage or drive certain young people, in particular the members or sympathisers of\\nsome illegal organisations, to commit similar violent acts with the aim of becoming,\\n“idols of the youth” themselves. The expressions used had given the impression to public\\nopinion – and in particular to people who shared similar political opinions to those\\npromoted by the perpetrators of the events in question – that, in order to fulfil a purpose\\nthat those individuals regarded as legitimate in terms of their ideology, the use of\\nviolence could be necessary and justified\\nIncitement to religious intolerance\\nİ.A. v. Turkey (no. 42571/98)\\n13 September 2005\\nThe applicant, the owner and managing director of a publishing company, published\\n2,000 copies of a book which addressed theological and philosophical issues in a\\nnovelistic style. The Istanbul public prosecutor charged the applicant with insulting “God,\\nthe Religion, the Prophet and the Holy Book” through the publication. The court of first\\ninstance sentenced the applicant to two years’ imprisonment and payment of a fine, and\\nimmediately commuted the prison sentence to a small fine. The applicant appealed to\\nthe Court of Cassation, which upheld the judgment. The applicant alleged that his\\nconviction and sentence had infringed his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It reiterated, in particular, that those who chose to exercise the\\nfreedom to manifest their religion, irrespective of whether they did so as members of a\\nreligious majority or a minority, could not reasonably expect to be exempt from all\\ncriticism. They had to tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs\\nand even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith. However, the\\npresent case concerned not only comments that were disturbing or shocking or a\\n“provocative” opinion but an abusive attack on the Prophet of Islam. Notwithstanding the\\nfact that there was a certain tolerance of criticism of religious doctrine within Turkish\\nsociety, which was deeply attached to the principle of secularity, believers could\\nlegitimately feel that certain passages of the book in question constituted an\\nunwarranted and offensive attack on them. In those circumstances, the Court considered\\nthat the measure in question had been intended to provide protection against offensive\\nattacks on matters regarded as sacred by Muslims and had therefore met a “pressing\\nsocial need”. It also took into account the fact that the Turkish courts had not decided to\\nseize the book in question, and consequently held that the insignificant fine imposed had\\nbeen proportionate to the aims pursued by the measure in question.\\nErbakan v. Turkey\\n6 July 2006\\nThe applicant, a politician, was notably Prime Minister of Turkey. At the material time he\\nwas chairman of Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party), which was dissolved in 1998 for\\nengaging in activities contrary to the principles of secularism. He complained in\\nparticular that his conviction for comments made in a public speech, which had been\\nheld to have constituted incitement to hatred and religious intolerance, had infringed his\\nright to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found that such comments – assuming they had in fact been made –\\nby a well-known politician at a public gathering were more indicative of a vision of\\nsociety structured exclusively around religious values and thus appeared hard to\\nreconcile with the pluralism typifying contemporary societies, where a wide range of\\n12Factshe et – Hate speech\\ndifferent groups were confronted with one another. Pointing out that combating all forms\\nof intolerance was an integral part of human-rights protection, the Court held that it was\\ncrucially important that in their speeches politicians should avoid making comments\\nliable to foster intolerance. However, having regard to the fundamental nature of free\\npolitical debate in a democratic society, the Court concluded that the reasons given to\\njustify the applicant’s prosecution were not sufficient to satisfy it that the interference\\nwith the exercise of his right to freedom of expression had been “necessary in a\\ndemocratic society”.\\nTagiyev and Huseynov v. Azerbaijan\\n5 December 2019\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicants – a well-known writer and columnist\\nand an editor – for inciting religious hatred and hostility with their remarks on Islam in\\nan article they had published in 2006.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the applicants’ conviction had been excessive and had\\nbreached their freedom of expression. It noted in particular that the national courts had\\nnot justified why the applicants’ conviction had been necessary when the article had\\nclearly only been comparing Western and Eastern values, and had contributed to a\\ndebate on a matter of public interest, namely the role of religion in society. Indeed,\\nthe courts had simply endorsed a report finding that certain remarks had amounted\\nto incitement to religious hatred and hostility, without putting them in context or even\\ntrying to balance the applicants’ right to impart to the public their views on religion\\nagainst the right of religious people to respect for their beliefs.\\nCondoning terrorism\\nLeroy v. France\\n2 October 2008\\nThe applicant, a cartoonist, complained of his conviction for publicly condoning terrorism\\nfollowing the publication in a Basque weekly newspaper on 13 September 2001 of a\\ndrawing representing the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center with a\\ncaption imitating the advertising slogan of a famous brand: “We all dreamt of it... Hamas\\ndid it”. He argued that his freedom of expression had been infringed.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in respect of the applicant’s conviction for complicity in condoning\\nterrorism. It considered, in particular, that the drawing was not limited to criticism of\\nAmerican imperialism, but supported and glorified the latter’s violent destruction. In this\\nregard, the Court based its finding on the caption which accompanied the drawing, and\\nnoted that the applicant had expressed his moral support for those whom he presumed\\nto be the perpetrators of the attacks of 11 September 2001. Through his choice of\\nlanguage, the applicant commented approvingly on the violence perpetrated against\\nthousands of civilians and diminished the dignity of the victims. In addition, it had to be\\nrecognised that the drawing had assumed a special significance in the circumstances of\\nthe case, as the applicant must have realised. Moreover, the impact of such a message\\nin a politically sensitive region, namely the Basque Country, was not to be overlooked;\\nthe weekly newspaper’s limited circulation notwithstanding, the Court noted that the\\ndrawing’s publication had provoked a certain public reaction, capable of stirring up\\nviolence and demonstrating a plausible impact on public order in the region.\\nConsequently, the Court considered that the grounds put forward by the domestic courts\\nin convicting the applicant had been relevant and sufficient and, having regard to the\\nmodest nature of the fine imposed on the applicant and the context in which the\\nimpugned drawing had been published, it found that the measure imposed on the\\napplicant had not been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\\n13Factshe et – Hate speech\\nStomakhin v. Russia7\\n9 May 2018\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction and sentence to five years in jail for\\nnewsletter articles he had written on the armed conflict in Chechnya, which the domestic\\ncourts said had justified terrorism and violence and incited hatred. He complained about\\nhis conviction for views expressed in the newsletters.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found in particular that some of the articles had gone beyond the\\nbounds of acceptable criticism and had amounted to calls for violence and the\\njustification of terrorism. Other statements, however, had been within acceptable limits\\nof criticism. Overall, there had not been a pressing social need to interfere with the\\napplicant’s rights by penalising him for some of his comments and the harshness of\\nthe penalty had violated his rights. The Court also added that it was vitally important for\\nStates to take a cautious approach when determining the scope of crimes of hate\\nspeech. It called on them to strictly construe legislation in order to avoid excessive\\ninterference under the guise of action against such speech, when what was in question\\nwas actually criticism of the authorities or their policies.\\nErkizia Almandoz v. Spain\\n22 June 2021\\nThis case concerned the participation by a Basque separatist politician in a ceremony to\\npay tribute to a former member of the ETA terrorist organisation, and his conviction for\\npublicly defending terrorism, receiving a one-year prison sentence and seven years’\\nineligibility. The applicant complained of an infringement of his right to freedom of\\nexpression on account of his conviction for publicly defending terrorism, whereas, in his\\nview, his speech had been aimed solely at initiating an exclusively democratic and\\npeaceful procedure for securing the independence of the Basque Country.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference by the public authorities with the\\napplicant’s right to freedom of expression could not be deemed “necessary in a\\ndemocratic society”. Having analysed the application of the various factors characterising\\nhate speech and statements condoning or defending terrorism, the Court found that\\nalthough the applicant had made his statements during a ceremony in memory of a\\nformer ETA member in a tense political and social context, the content and formulation\\nof the applicant’s comments showed that he had not intended to incite people to violence\\nor to condone or defend terrorism. In the Court’s view, no direct or indirect incitement to\\nterrorist violence had been established, and the applicant’s speech at the ceremony had,\\non the contrary, advocated pursuing a democratic means of achieving the specific\\npolitical objectives of the abertzale left.\\nRouillan v. France\\n23 June 2022\\nThis case concerned the sentencing of the applicant, formerly a member of the terrorist\\ngroup Action directe, to a term of 18 months’ imprisonment including a suspended\\nportion of 10 months with probation, upon his conviction as an accessory to the offence\\nof publicly defending acts of terrorism for remarks he had made on a radio show in 2016\\nand which had subsequently been published on a media website.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention on account of the severity of the criminal penalty imposed on the\\napplicant. It took the view, in particular, that the applicant’s conviction and sentencing\\nas an accessory to the offence of defending acts of terrorism had amounted to an\\ninterference with his right to freedom of expression, and recognised that the interference\\nhad been prescribed by law and had pursued the legitimate aim of preventing disorder\\nand crime. Turning to whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society\\nwithin the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, the Court accepted, first, that the\\n7. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n14Factshe et – Hate speech\\nremarks in issue fell to be regarded as an indirect incitement to terrorist violence and\\nsaw no reasonable basis on which to depart from the meaning and scope attached to\\nthem by a decision of the Criminal Court, whose duly stated reasons had been adopted\\nby the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. The Court further stated that it saw\\nno reasonable ground, in this case, on which to depart from the domestic courts’\\nassessment regarding the principle behind the penalty. It held in this regard that their\\nreasoning as to why the penalty imposed on the applicant had been warranted – based\\non the need to combat defence of terrorism and on consideration of the offender’s\\npersonal characteristics – appeared both “relevant” and “sufficient” to justify the\\ninterference at issue, which fell to be regarded as responding, in principle, to a pressing\\nsocial need. However, after reiterating that the authorities were required, in matters of\\nfreedom of expression, to exercise restraint in the use of criminal proceedings and\\nespecially in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, the Court held that, in the\\nparticular circumstances of the case, the reasons relied on by the domestic courts in the\\nbalancing exercise which had been theirs to perform were not sufficient to enable it to\\nregard the 18 month prison sentence passed on the applicant – the suspension of\\n10 months notwithstanding – as proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\\nRivadulla Duró v. Spain\\n12 October 2023 (decision – Committee – on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s – a rapper also known as “Pablo Hasél” – conviction\\nand custodial sentence on charges of public praise or justification of terrorism, insult and\\nslander against the Crown, and insult and slander against State institutions, for the\\ncontent of several social-media posts and a song about King Emeritus Juan Carlos I\\nof Spain. The applicant complained of a breach of his freedom of expression in the\\nnational court decisions, which had been linked to his ideological freedom, and alleged\\nthat the purpose of the punishment had been to silence him.\\nThe Court declared inadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, the applicant’s\\ncomplaints under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention. As regards the\\nconviction for public praise or justification of terrorism, it noted, in particular, that the\\nSpanish courts had found that the applicant’s comments and songs had been incitement\\nto support terrorism, a finding which the Court agreed with. The Court also noted that\\nthese statements had been available to a wide audience and had had the capacity to\\nlead to harmful consequences. It found that the Spanish courts’ assessment had been\\nreasonable and proportionate. They had examined the applicant’s case in the light of the\\nCourt’s relevant case-law, and the reason for their judgments – combating public praise\\nor justification of terrorism – appeared to have been “relevant” and “sufficient” to justify\\nthe interference with the applicant’s rights. Concerning the custodial sentence handed\\ndown, the Court noted that had it not been for the applicant’s prior conviction, he would\\nnot have served time for the offence in question. As further regards the conviction for\\nslander against the Head of State and the State institutions, the Court noted that the\\napplicant had made the relevant statements in his capacity as an artist, including\\nrepeated accusations of torture, murder, Nazism, and so forth. The Court considered\\nthat the Audiencia Nacional had carefully considered the case in the light of the Court’s\\ncase-law and had weighed up the various interests involved, before finding him guilty.\\nThat conviction could not be considered disproportionate.\\nSee also: Jorge López v. Spain, decision (Committee) on the admissibility of\\n20 September 2022.\\nIncitement to ethnic hatred\\nBalsytė-Lideikienė v. Lithuania\\n4 November 2008\\nThe applicant owned a publishing company. In March 2001 the Polish courts found that\\nshe had breached the Code on Administrative Offences on account of her publishing and\\ndistributing the “Lithuanian calendar 2000” which, according to the conclusions of\\n15Factshe et – Hate speech\\npolitical science experts, promoted ethnic hatred. She was issued with an\\nadministrative warning and the unsold copies of the calendar were confiscated. The\\napplicant alleged in particular that the confiscation of the calendar and the ban on its\\nfurther distribution had infringed her right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It found, in particular, that the applicant had expressed aggressive\\nnationalism and ethnocentrism and statements inciting hatred against the Poles and the\\nJews which were capable of giving the Lithuanian authorities cause for serious concern.\\nHaving regard to the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States in such\\ncircumstances, the Court found that in the present case the domestic authorities had not\\noverstepped their margin of appreciation when they considered that there was a\\npressing social need to take measures against the applicant. The Court also noted that\\neven though the confiscation measure imposed on the applicant could be deemed\\nrelatively serious, she had not had a fine imposed on her, but only a warning, which was\\nthe mildest administrative punishment available. Therefore, the Court found that the\\ninterference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression could reasonably have\\nbeen considered “necessary in a democratic society” for the protection of the reputation\\nor rights of others.\\nAtamanchuk v. Russia8\\n11 February 2020\\nThis case concerned a businessman’s criminal conviction for inciting hatred and enmity\\nfollowing statements about non Russians in an article published in a local newspaper.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the Russian courts had given relevant and sufficient\\nreasons in the context of the case for prosecuting and convicting the applicant and that\\nthere had been exceptional circumstances justifying the sentences imposed on him.\\nIt noted in particular that the applicant’s sweeping remarks had not contributed to any\\npublic debate and agreed with the national courts’ assessment of them as stirring up\\nemotions or prejudices against the local population of non-Russian ethnicity. Moreover,\\nthe courts had been justified in fining him and banning him from journalistic or\\npublishing activities for two years, given that those sentences had been imposed in the\\ncontext of legislation against hate speech. In addition, the sentences had not had any\\nsignificant consequences for the applicant who was more of a businessman than\\na journalist.\\nDenigrating national identity\\nDink v. Turkey\\n14 September 2010\\nFirat (Hrank) Dink, a Turkish journalist of Armenian origin, was publication director and\\neditor-in-chief of a bilingual Turkish-Armenian weekly newspaper published in Istanbul.\\nFollowing the publication in this newspaper of eight articles in which he expressed his\\nviews on the identity of Turkish citizens of Armenian origin, he was found guilty in 2006\\nof “denigrating Turkish identity”. In 2007 he was killed by three bullets to the head as he\\nleft the offices of the newspaper. The applicants, his relatives, complained in particular of\\nthe guilty verdict against him which, they claimed, had made him a target for extreme\\nnationalist groups.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that there had been no pressing social need to find Fırat Dink\\nguilty of denigrating “Turkishness”. It observed, in particular, that the series of articles\\ntaken overall did not incite others to violence, resistance or revolt. The author had been\\nwriting in his capacity as a journalist and editor-in-chief of a Turkish-Armenian\\nnewspaper, commenting on issues concerning the Armenian minority in the context of\\nhis role as a player on the political scene. He had merely been conveying his ideas and\\n8.

In such societies, the\\ndebate surrounding historical events of a particularly serious nature should be able to\\ntake place freely, and it was an integral part of freedom of expression to seek historical\\ntruth. Finally, the impugned articles had not been gratuitously offensive or insulting, and\\nthey had not incited others to disrespect or hatred.\\nInsult of State officials\\nOtegi Mondragon v. Spain\\n15 March 2011\\nThe applicant, the spokesperson for a left-wing Basque separatist parliamentary group,\\nreferred at a press conference to the closure of a Basque daily newspaper (on account of\\nits suspected links with ETA) and to the alleged ill-treatment of the persons arrested\\nduring the police operation. In his statement he referred to the King of Spain as “the\\nsupreme head of the Spanish armed forces, in other words, the person in command of\\nthe torturers, who defends torture and imposes his monarchic regime on our people\\nthrough torture and violence”. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment\\nfor the offence of serious insult against the King. He alleged a breach of his right to\\nfreedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the applicant’s conviction and sentence had been\\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the King of\\nSpain’s reputation, as guaranteed by the Spanish Constitution. The Court observed in\\nparticular that, while it was true that the language used by the applicant could have\\nbeen considered provocative, it was essential to bear in mind that, even if some of the\\nwords used in the applicant’s comments had been hostile in nature, there had been no\\nincitement to violence and they had not amounted to hate speech. Furthermore, these\\nhad been oral statements made in the course of a press conference, which meant that\\nthe applicant had been unable to reformulate, rephrase or withdraw them before they\\nwere made public.\\nStern Taulats and Roura Capellera v. Spain\\n13 March 2018\\nThis case concerned the conviction of two Spanish nationals for setting fire to a\\nphotograph of the royal couple at a public demonstration held during the King’s official\\nvisit to Girona in September 2007. The applicants complained in particular that the\\njudgment finding them guilty of insult to the Crown amounted to unjustified interference\\nwith their right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found in particular that the act allegedly committed by the applicants\\nhad been part of a political, rather than personal, critique of the institution of monarchy\\nin general, and in particular of the Kingdom of Spain as a nation. It also noted that it\\nwas one of those provocative “events” which were increasingly being “staged” to attract\\nmedia attention and which went no further than the use of a certain permissible degree\\nof provocation in order to transmit a critical message in the framework of freedom of\\nexpression. Moreover, the Court was not convinced that the impugned act could\\nreasonably be construed as incitement to hatred or violence. In the present case,\\nincitement to violence could not be deduced from the joint examination of the “props”\\nused for staging the event or from the context in which it had taken place; nor could it\\nbe established on the basis of the consequences of the act, which had not led to violent\\nbehaviour or disorder. Furthermore, the facts could not be considered as constituting\\nhate speech. Lastly, the Court held that the prison sentence served on the applicants\\nhad been neither proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (protection of the\\nreputation or rights of others) nor “necessary in a democratic society”.\\n17Factshe et – Hate speech\\nRivadulla Duró v. Spain\\n12 October 2023 (decision – Committee – on the admissibility)\\nSee above, under “Apology of terrorism”.\\nAgitation against a national or ethnic group\\nVejdeland and Others v. Sweden\\n9 February 2012\\nThis case concerned the applicants’ conviction for distributing in an upper secondary\\nschool approximately 100 leaflets considered by the courts to be offensive to\\nhomosexuals. The applicants had distributed leaflets by an organisation called National\\nYouth, by leaving them in or on the pupils’ lockers. The statements in the leaflets were,\\nin particular, allegations that homosexuality was a “deviant sexual proclivity”, had “a\\nmorally destructive effect on the substance of society” and was responsible for the\\ndevelopment of HIV and AIDS. The applicants claimed that they had not intended to\\nexpress contempt for homosexuals as a group and stated that the purpose of their\\nactivity had been to start a debate about the lack of objectivity in the education in\\nSwedish schools.\\nThe Court found that these statements had constituted serious and prejudicial\\nallegations, even if they had not been a direct call to hateful acts. The Court stressed\\nthat discrimination based on sexual orientation was as serious as discrimination based\\non race, origin or colour. It concluded that there had been no violation of Article 10\\n(freedom of expression) of the Convention, as the interference with the applicants’\\nexercise of their right to freedom of expression had reasonably been regarded by the\\nSwedish authorities as “necessary in a democratic society” for the protection of the\\nreputation and rights of others.\\nDisplay of a symbol associated with a political movement\\nor entity\\nFáber v. Hungary\\n24 July 2012\\nThe applicant complained that he had been fined for displaying the striped Árpád flag,\\nwhich had controversial historical connotations, less than 100 metres away from a\\ndemonstration against racism and hatred.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nread in the light of Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association of the\\nConvention. It accepted that the display of a symbol, which was ubiquitous during the\\nreign of a totalitarian regime in Hungary, might create uneasiness amongst past victims\\nand their relatives who could rightly find such displays disrespectful. It nevertheless\\nfound that such sentiments, however understandable, could not alone set the limits of\\nfreedom of expression. In addition, the applicant had not behaved in an abusive or\\nthreatening manner. In view of his non-violent behaviour, of the distance between him\\nand the demonstrators, and of the absence of any proven risk to public security, the\\nCourt found that the Hungarian authorities had not justified prosecuting and fining the\\napplicant for refusing to take down the flag in question. The mere display of that flag did\\nnot disturb public order or hamper the demonstrators’ right to assemble, as it had been\\nneither intimidating, nor capable of inciting violence.\\nIncitement to national hatred\\nHösl-Daum and Others v. Poland\\n7 October 2014 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicants were charged with insulting the Polish nation and inciting national hatred.\\nThey alleged a breach of their right to freedom of expression on account of their\\nconviction for putting up posters in the German language describing atrocities committed\\n18Factshe et – Hate speech\\nafter the Second World War by the Polish and the Czechs against the Germans.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic\\nremedies. It found that, by failing to lodge a constitutional complaint against the\\nimpugned provisions of the Criminal Code, the applicants had failed to exhaust the\\nremedy provided for by Polish law.\\nExtremism\\nIbragim Ibragimov and Others v. Russia9\\n28 August 2018\\nThis case concerned anti-extremism legislation in Russia and a ban on publishing and\\ndistributing Islamic books. The applicants complained that the Russian courts had ruled\\nin 2007 and 2010 that books by Said Nursi, a well-known Turkish Muslim theologian and\\ncommentator of the Qur’an, were extremist and banned their publication and\\ndistribution. The applicants had either published some of Nursi’s books or had\\ncommissioned them for publication.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. The Court found in particular that the Russian courts had not justified\\nwhy the ban had been necessary. They had merely endorsed the overall findings of an\\nexpert report carried out by linguists and psychologists, without making their own\\nanalysis or, most notably, setting the books or certain of their expressions considered\\nproblematic in context. Furthermore, they had summarily rejected all the applicants’\\nevidence explaining that Nursi’s books belonged to moderate, mainstream Islam.\\nOverall, the courts’ analysis in the applicants’ cases had not shown how Nursi’s books,\\nalready in publication for seven years before being banned, had ever caused, or risked\\ncausing, interreligious tensions, let alone violence, in Russia or, indeed, in any of the\\nother countries where they were widely available.\\nYefimov and Youth Human Rights Group v. Russia10\\n7 December 2021\\nThis case concerned, in particular, the prosecution of the first applicant – who was\\nthe founder and director of the applicant association – for hate speech and his placement\\non a list of terrorists and extremists for publishing a note criticising the Russian\\nOrthodox Church.\\nThe Court held, in particular, that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom\\nof expression) of the Convention, in respect of the first applicant, finding that the\\npublication had not been shown to be capable of inciting violence, hatred or intolerance\\nor causing public disturbances.\\nSee also: Mukhin v.

It noted in particular that the sanction in question\\nhad been imposed on the applicant following new legal requirements for missionary work\\nintroduced in Russia in 2016 as part of an anti-terrorism package. The new legislation\\nmade it an offence to evangelise in private homes and required prior authorisation for\\nmissionary work from a religious group or organisation. In the present case, the Court\\nfound that the Russian Government had not explained the rationale behind such new\\nformalities for missionary work which had left no room for people engaged in individual\\nevangelism, such as the applicant. Further, there was no evidence that the applicant had\\nused any improper methods of proselytism, involving coercion or incitement to hatred or\\nintolerance. The Court also held that there had been a violation of Article 14\\n(prohibition of discrimination) of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 9\\nin respect of the applicant in the present case.\\nPublishing statements by a terrorist organisation\\nAli Gürbüz v. Turkey\\n12 March 2019\\nThis case concerned seven sets of criminal proceedings brought against the applicant –\\nthe owner of the daily newspaper Ülkede Özgür Gündem, at the relevant time – for\\npublishing, in the newspaper, statements by the leaders of organisations characterised\\nas terrorist under Turkish law. He was acquitted after proceedings which had lasted\\nbetween five and over seven years, without having been remanded in custody.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the fact that the numerous sets of criminal proceedings\\nagainst the applicant had been prolonged for a considerable length of time, on the basis\\nof serious criminal charges, did not meet a pressing social need, that the impugned\\nmeasure had not been proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, and that the\\nmeasure was accordingly not necessary in a democratic society. The Court noted, in\\nparticular, that criminal proceedings had been systematically opened, regardless of the\\nactual content of the articles. They had in fact contained insignificant messages such as\\nChristmas wishes which did not call for any violence, armed resistance or uprising, and\\ndid not constitute hate speech, that being an essential factor to be considered.\\nGürbüz and Bayar v. Turkey\\n23 July 2019\\nThe case concerned criminal proceedings brought against the applicants – who were\\nrespectively, at the relevant time, the owner and the editor-in-chief of the daily\\nnewspaper Ülkede Özgür Gündem – for publishing statements by A.Ö. (head of the\\nKurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an illegal armed organisation) and M.K. (president of\\nKongra-Gel, a branch of the PKK) in an article which appeared in their newspaper in\\nSeptember 2004. After several years the first applicant’s prosecution became time-\\nbarred; the second applicant received a suspended judicial fine.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in the present case, finding, in particular, that the contested\\ninterference had not been disproportionate, given, firstly, the margin of appreciation\\nenjoyed by the national authorities in such cases and, secondly, the statute-barring and\\nsuspended sentence from which the applicants had benefited respectively. The Court\\nrecalled, inter alia, that the mere fact of having published statements by terrorist\\norganisations could not justify media professionals being systematically convicted by the\\ncourts without an analysis of the content of the contested articles or the context in which\\nthey were written. It added that, however, when it came to statements which could be\\nheld to amount to hate speech or to glorification of or incitement to violence, the Court\\nitself analysed the contested articles, notwithstanding the fact that the reasons given by\\nthe courts for the convictions in question had been clearly insufficient. In the instant\\ncase, the Court considered that, given that A.Ö.’s statements could effectively be\\n20Factshe et – Hate speech\\ninterpreted as an incitement to violence, the applicants could not, in their respective\\ncapacities as owner and editor-in-chief of their newspaper, be exempted from all liability.\\nThe right to impart information could not serve as an alibi or pretext for disseminating\\nstatements by terrorist groups.\\nPropaganda for a terrorist organisation\\nÖzer v. Turkey (no. 3)\\n11 February 2020\\nThis case concerned criminal proceedings brought against the applicant, the owner and\\neditor of a magazine, over an article published in the magazine. The applicant was\\nprosecuted and convicted of the criminal offence of providing propaganda for a terrorist\\norganisation. He complained of an infringement of his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the Turkish authorities had failed to conduct an appropriate\\nanalysis having regard to all the criteria set out and implemented by the Court in cases\\nconcerning freedom of expression, and that the Turkish Government had not\\ndemonstrated that the impugned measure had met a pressing social need, had been\\nproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and had been necessary in a democratic\\nsociety. The Court noted in particular that the domestic courts’ assessment of the case\\nhad not answered the question of whether the impugned passages of the article in\\nquestion could – having regard to their content, context and capacity to lead to harmful\\nconsequences – be considered as comprising incitement to the use of violence, armed\\nresistance or rebellion, or as amounting to hate speech.\\nÜçdağ v. Turkey\\n31 August 2021\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s criminal conviction for disseminating propaganda in\\nfavour of a terrorist organisation on account of two posts published on his Facebook\\naccount, as well as the rejection of his individual application to the Constitutional Court\\nas being out of time. At the relevant time, the applicant was a public official working as\\nan imam at a local mosque. The impugned posts had included two photographs (of\\nindividuals in uniform similar to that of PKK members and of a crowd demonstrating in a\\npublic street in front of a fire), originally shared by two other Facebook users.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that by convicting the applicant on a charge of disseminating\\npropaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation by posting the impugned contents on his\\nFacebook account, the domestic authorities had failed to conduct an appropriate\\nbalancing exercise, in keeping with the criteria set out in its case-law, between the\\napplicant’s right to freedom of expression and the legitimate aims pursued (protecting\\nnational security and territorial integrity and preventing disorder and crime).\\nIn particular the assessment carried out by the domestic courts had not explained\\nwhether the sharing of the posts in question could have been considered, in view of their\\ncontent, context and capacity to lead to harmful consequences having regard to their\\npotential impact on the social networks under the circumstances of the case, as\\ncomprising incitement to the use of violence, armed resistance or uprising, or as\\namounting to hate speech. In the present case, the Turkish Government had not\\ndemonstrated that the grounds relied on by the domestic authorities to justify the\\nimpugned measure had been relevant and sufficient and had been necessary in a\\ndemocratic society.\\n21Factshe et – Hate speech\\nPublicly mocking, defaming, denigrating or threatening a\\nperson or group of persons for certain characteristics, including\\ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity\\nLilliendahl v. Iceland\\n12 May 2020 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction and fine for homophobic comments he\\nhad made in response to an online article. The applicant alleged that his conviction had\\nbreached his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention was manifestly ill-founded and rejected it as inadmissible. It found that\\nthe applicant’s comments had amounted to hate speech within the meaning of its case-\\nlaw. The Court accepted in particular the Icelandic Supreme Court’s finding that the\\ncomments had been “serious, severely hurtful and prejudicial”, and that the decision\\nwhich had originally sparked the debate, concerning measures to strengthen education\\nin schools on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender matters, had not warranted such a\\nsevere reaction. The domestic courts’ decisions in the case, taken after an extensive\\nbalancing exercise between the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and the rights\\nof gender and sexual minorities, had therefore been reasonable and justified.\\nPraising crime and criminals\\nYasin Özdemir v. Turkey\\n7 December 2021\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant, a teacher, for praising crime\\nand criminals, on account of comments which he had posted on the social networks in\\nApril 2015, in favour of the Gülenist organisation and its leader (Fethullah Gülen).\\nThe applicant complained about his conviction, arguing that at the time he had published\\nthe contested comments, the organisation in question had not been known as a\\nterrorist organisation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s exercise of his right to\\nfreedom of expression had failed to meet the “quality of the law” requirement. It noted,\\nin particular, that the applicant had been convicted with final effect of praising crime or\\ncriminals, and that his conviction had been based solely on the comments which he had\\nposted on Facebook concerning newspaper articles. The Court took the view that the\\ncomments in question had mainly consisted of the applicant’s opinions on topical political\\nissues. Furthermore, at the time of their publication, the messages had contained ideas\\nand opinions expressed in the framework of public debates on certain sensitive\\nsubjects – similar ideas had already been expressed not only by members of the Gülenist\\nmovement but also by the legal opposition, including political opposition parties, as well\\nas by the national and international media. Lastly, those opinions had in no way incited\\npeople to commit violence or revolt.\\nRacial insults and questioning the existence of crimes against\\nhumanity\\nBonnet v. France\\n25 January 2022 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant, known as Alain Soral, by\\nthe French courts for the offence of proffering a public insult of a racial nature against an\\nindividual or group on account of their origin or of belonging to a given ethnicity, nation,\\nrace or religion, and for the offence of questioning the existence of crimes against\\nhumanity. This conviction followed the publication, on the website “Equality and\\nReconciliation”, of a page headed “Chutzpah Hebdo”, a parody of the front page of the\\n22Factshe et – Hate speech\\nweekly Charlie Hebdo, containing the caption “historians all at sea” and a drawing\\nrepresenting the face of Charlie Chaplin in front of a Star of David asking the question\\n“Shoah where are you?”, the answer being given in a number of speech bubbles, “here”,\\n“over here” and “here too”, placed next to drawings depicting soap, a lamp-shade, a\\nshoe without laces and a wig. The applicant complained of a violation of his freedom\\nof expression.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, finding\\nthat, even supposing that Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention was\\napplicable, the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression had been\\nnecessary in a democratic society. The Court took the view, in particular, that the\\ndomestic courts had provided relevant and sufficient reasons for their finding that the\\nvarious elements of the offending cartoon directly targeted the Jewish Community.\\nThe cartoon and the message it conveyed could not be regarded as contributing to any\\ndebate in the public interest and fell within a category which was afforded reduced\\nprotection under Article 10 of the Convention. Further, as to the context, the Court noted\\nthat the French authorities had already been called upon to respond to remarks or\\nspeech calling into question or denying the existence of the Holocaust, which was a\\nclearly established historical event. As to the underlying factors, namely the nature,\\nmedium and context of the offending cartoon, the domestic courts had examined the\\ncase in detail and had weighed in the balance the various interests at stake: the\\napplicant’s right to freedom of expression, on the one hand, and the protection of the\\nrights of others, on the other, on the basis of sufficient and relevant reasons. The Court\\nlastly noted that while a prison sentence could have been handed down, the applicant\\nhad been sentenced on appeal to pay 10,000 euros, and that while this was a significant\\namount it was less than that imposed at first instance.\\nVerbally insulting the national flag\\nFragoso Dacosta v. Spain\\n8 June 2023\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s criminal conviction (a fine of 1,260 euros), for having\\ninsulted the Spanish flag while protesting as a trade union representative, over unpaid\\nwages of the cleaners of the Ferrol Military Arsenal building, a military base under the\\nresponsibility of the Ministry of Defence. From October 2014-March 2015, the\\nemployees, together with some trade-union representatives, held daily protests in front\\nof the arsenal, shouting slogans, whistling and generally being noisy. Those protests\\ncoincided with the solemn daily raising of the national flag in the presence of the\\nmilitary. The applicant complained that the criminal sanction imposed on him had\\nviolated his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in respect of the applicant, as it was not persuaded that the domestic\\nauthorities had struck a fair balance between the relevant interests at stake when\\nconvicting the applicant and imposing such an excessive sanction on him. In particular,\\nwhile the Court accepted that the language used by the applicant could have been\\nconsidered provocative and the use of expletives gratuitous, there had been no\\nindications of disorder or disturbances following his statements and neither the Audiencia\\nProvincial nor the Spanish Government had sought to justify his conviction by reference\\nto incitement to violence or hate speech. Further, although the Constitutional Court had\\nreferred to a “feeling of intolerance” transmitted by the applicant, it had not examined\\nwhether there had been sufficient grounds to find that his statements had amounted to\\nhate speech, such as the existence of a tense political or social background or the\\ncapacity of the statements to lead to harmful consequences.\\n23Factshe et – Hate speech\\nOnline hate speech\\nDelfi AS v. Estonia\\n16 June 2015 (Grand Chamber)\\nThis was the first case in which the Court had been called upon to examine a complaint\\nabout liability for user-generated comments on an Internet news portal. The applicant\\ncompany, which runs a news portal run on a commercial basis, complained that it had\\nbeen held liable by the national courts for the offensive comments posted by its readers\\nbelow one of its online news articles about a ferry company. At the request of the\\nlawyers of the owner of the ferry company, the applicant company removed the\\noffensive comments about six weeks after their publication.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It first noted the conflicting realities between the benefits of Internet,\\nnotably the unprecedented platform it provided for freedom of expression, and its\\ndangers, namely the possibility of hate speech and speech inciting violence being\\ndisseminated worldwide in a matter of seconds and sometimes remaining remain\\npersistently available online. The Court further observed that the unlawful nature of the\\ncomments in question was obviously based on the fact that the majority of the\\ncomments were, viewed on their face, tantamount to an incitement to hatred or to\\nviolence against the owner of the ferry company. Consequently, the case concerned the\\nduties and responsibilities of Internet news portals, under Article 10 § 2 of the\\nConvention, which provided on a commercial basis a platform for user-generated\\ncomments on previously published content and some users – whether identified or\\nanonymous – engaged in clearly unlawful speech, which infringed the personality rights\\nof others and amounted to hate speech and incitement to violence against them.\\nIn cases such as the present one, where third-party user comments are in the form of\\nhate speech and direct threats to the physical integrity of individuals, the Court\\nconsidered that the rights and interests of others and of society as a whole may entitle\\nContracting States to impose liability on Internet news portals, without contravening\\nArticle 10 of the Convention, if they fail to take measures to remove clearly unlawful\\ncomments without delay, even without notice from the alleged victim or from third\\nparties. Based on the concrete assessment of these aspects and taking into account, in\\nparticular, the extreme nature of the comments in question, the fact that they had been\\nposted in reaction to an article published by the applicant company on its professionally\\nmanaged news portal run on a commercial basis, the insufficiency of the measures taken\\nby the applicant company to remove without delay after publication comments\\namounting to hate speech and speech inciting violence and to ensure a realistic prospect\\nof the authors of such comments being held liable, and the moderate sanction (320\\neuro) imposed on the applicant company, the Court found that the Estonian courts’\\nfinding of liability against the applicant company had been a justified and proportionate\\nrestriction on the portal’s freedom of expression.\\nMagyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt v. Hungary\\n2 February 2016\\nThis case concerned the liability of a self-regulatory body of Internet content providers\\nand an Internet news portal for vulgar and offensive online comments posted on their\\nwebsites following the publication of an opinion criticising the misleading business\\npractices of two real estate websites. The applicants complained about the Hungarian\\ncourts’ rulings against them, which had effectively obliged them to moderate the\\ncontents of comments made by readers on their websites, arguing that that had gone\\nagainst the essence of free expression on the Internet.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It reiterated in particular that, although not publishers of comments\\nin the traditional sense, Internet news portals had to, in principle, assume duties and\\nresponsibilities. However, the Court considered that the Hungarian courts, when deciding\\non the notion of liability in the applicants’ case, had not carried out a proper balancing\\n24Factshe et – Hate speech\\nexercise between the competing rights involved, namely between the applicants’ right\\nto freedom of expression and the real estate websites’ right to respect for its commercial\\nreputation. Notably, the Hungarian authorities accepted at face value that the comments\\nhad been unlawful as being injurious to the reputation of the real estate websites.\\nIt is to be noted that the applicants’ case was different in some aspects from the Delfi AS\\nv. Estonia case (see above) in which the Court had held that a commercially-run Internet\\nnews portal had been liable for the offensive online comments of its readers. The\\napplicants’ case was notably devoid of the pivotal elements in the Delfi AS case of hate\\nspeech and incitement to violence. Although offensive and vulgar, the comments in the\\npresent case had not constituted clearly unlawful speech. Furthermore, while Index is\\nthe owner of a large media outlet which must be regarded as having economic interests,\\nMagyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete is a non-profit self-regulatory association of\\nInternet service providers, with no known such interests.\\nPihl v. Sweden\\n7 February 2017 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThe applicant had been the subject of a defamatory online comment, which had been\\npublished anonymously on a blog. He made a civil claim against the small non-profit\\nassociation which ran the blog, claiming that it should be held liable for the third-party\\ncomment. The claim was rejected by the Swedish courts and the Chancellor of Justice.\\nThe applicant complained to the Court that by failing to hold the association liable, the\\nauthorities had failed to protect his reputation and had violated his right to respect for\\nhis private life.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.\\nIt noted in particular that, in cases such as this, a balance must be struck between an\\nindividual’s right to respect for his private life, and the right to freedom of expression\\nenjoyed by an individual or group running an internet portal. In light of the\\ncircumstances of this case, the Court found that national authorities had struck a fair\\nbalance when refusing to hold the association liable for the anonymous comment.\\nIn particular, this was because: although the comment had been offensive, it had not\\namounted to hate speech or an incitement to violence; it had been posted on a small\\nblog run by a non-profit association; it had been taken down the day after the applicant\\nhad made a complaint; and it had only been on the blog for around nine days.\\nSmajić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n18 January 2018 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction for incitement to national, racial and\\nreligious hatred, discord or intolerance following a number of posts on an Internet forum\\ndescribing military action which could be undertaken against Serb villages in the Brčko\\nDistrict in the event of another war. The applicant alleged in particular that he had been\\nconvicted for expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern.\\nThe Court declared the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. It found in particular\\nthat the domestic courts had examined the applicant’s case with care, giving sufficient\\njustification for his conviction, namely that he had used highly insulting expressions\\ntowards Serbs, thus touching upon the very sensitive matter of ethnic relations in\\npost-conflict Bosnian society. Furthermore, the penalties imposed on him, namely a\\nsuspended sentence and a seized computer and laptop, had not been excessive.\\nTherefore, the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression, which\\nhad been prescribed by law and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the\\nreputation and rights of others, did not disclose any appearance of a violation of\\nArticle 10 of the Convention.\\nNix v. Germany\\n13 mars 2018 (décision sur la recevabilité)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction for posting picture of a Nazi leader and\\nswastika in a blog. The applicant argued that the domestic courts had failed to take into\\n25Factshe et – Hate speech\\naccount that his blog post was intended as a protest against school and employment\\noffices’ discrimination against children from a migrant background.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.\\nWhile accepting that the applicant had not intended to spread totalitarian propaganda, to\\nincite violence, or to utter hate speech, and might have thought he was contributing to a\\ndebate of public interest, it considered that the domestic courts could not be reproached\\nfor concluding that he had used the picture of the former SS chief Heinrich Himmler with\\nthe swastika as an “eye-catching” device, which was one of the things the law penalising\\nthe use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations had been intended to prevent (the\\nso-called “communicative taboo”). Domestic case-law was clear that the critical use of\\nsuch symbols was not enough to exempt someone from criminal liability and that what\\nwas required was clear and obvious opposition to Nazi ideology. In the applicant’s case,\\nthe Court saw no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ assessment that the\\napplicant had not clearly and obviously rejected Nazi ideology in his blog post. The Court\\ntherefore concluded that the domestic authorities had provided relevant and sufficient\\nreasons for interfering with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and had not\\ngone beyond their room for manoeuvre (“margin of appreciation”) in the case.\\nSavva Terentyev v. Russia12\\n28 August 2018\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction for inciting hatred after making insulting\\nremarks about police officers in a comment under a blog post.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found in particular that while the applicant’s language had been\\noffensive and shocking that alone was not enough to justify interfering with his right to\\nfreedom of expression. The domestic courts should have looked at the overall context of\\nhis comments, which had been a provocative attempt to express his anger at what\\nhe perceived to be police interference, rather than an actual call to physical violence\\nagainst the police.\\nKilin v. Russia13\\n11 May 2021\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s trial and conviction for disseminating extremist\\nmaterials. The applicant in this case had been accused of posting allegedly racist video\\nand audio files involving neo-Nazis, racial epithets, people of apparently Caucasian\\ndescent and calls to extremism on a popular online social network. He complained in\\nparticular that his criminal conviction had been in violation of his rights.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. In the circumstances of the case, and given the racist nature of the\\nmaterial and the absence of any commentary on such content, it found that the domestic\\ncourts had convincingly demonstrated that the impugned material had incited ethnic\\ndiscord and, foremost, the applicant’s clear intention of bringing about the commission of\\nrelated acts of hatred or intolerance. Moreover, while there was no indication that the\\nmaterial had been published against a sensitive social or political background, or that at\\nthe time the general security situation in Russia had been tense, those elements had not\\nbeen decisive in the present case. Lastly, the nature and severity of the penalties\\nimposed (a suspended eighteen-month term of imprisonment with a similar period of\\nprobation and some other requirements) had been proportionate in the specific\\ncircumstances.\\nStandard Verlagsgesellschaft mbH v. Austria (No. 3)\\n7 December 2021\\nThis case concerned court orders for the applicant media company to reveal the sign-up\\ninformation of registered users who had posted comments on its website, the website of\\n12. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n13. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n26Factshe et – Hate speech\\nthe newspaper Der Standard. This had followed comments allegedly linking politicians to,\\namong other things, corruption or neo-Nazis, which the applicant company had\\nremoved, albeit refusing to reveal the information of the commenters.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the domestic courts had overall failed to balance the rights\\nat issue and to give sufficient reasons to justify the interference with the applicant\\ncompany’s rights. It considered, in particular, that the comments at issue had been\\nneither hate speech nor incitement to violence, and had been about two politicians and a\\npolitical party in a political debate of public interest. The court orders had thus not been\\n“necessary in a democratic society”.\\nSanchez v. France\\n15 May 2023 (Grand Chamber)\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant, at the time a local councillor\\nwho was standing for election to Parliament, for incitement to hatred or violence against\\na group of people or an individual on the grounds of their membership of a specific\\nreligion, following his failure to take prompt action in deleting comments posted by\\nothers on the wall of his Facebook account. The applicant alleged that his conviction had\\nbreached his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that, taking account of the State’s margin of appreciation,\\nthe decisions of the domestic courts had been based on relevant and sufficient grounds,\\nwith regard both to the applicant’s liability, as a politician, for the unlawful comments\\nposted by the third parties, who had themselves been identified and prosecuted as\\naccomplices, and to the applicant’s criminal conviction. The interference in question\\ncould thus be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court noted in\\nparticular that the criminal case had turned solely on the applicant’s lack of vigilance and\\nfailure to react in respect of comments posted by others. It had thus raised the question\\nof the shared liability of the various actors involved in social media. The French criminal\\ncourts, applying a “cascading liability” regime introduced by the Law of 29 July 1982,\\nhad convicted the authors for the unlawful messages together with the applicant as the\\nFacebook account holder, being characterised as “producer”. First, the Court considered\\nthat the domestic legal framework, providing for a sharing of liability between all those\\ninvolved, had been sufficiently precise, for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention,\\nto enable the applicant to regulate his conduct in the circumstances. Secondly, the Court\\nagreed with the domestic courts that the comments at issue, which had been posted in\\nthe specific context of a forthcoming election, could be classified as hate speech, when\\ninterpreted and analysed in terms of their immediate impact, and were therefore\\nunlawful. Thirdly, it took the view that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of\\nexpression pursued not only the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of\\nothers, but also that of preventing disorder or crime. Further, as the applicant had\\ndecided to make his Facebook “wall” publicly accessible and had “authorised his friends\\nto post comments”, in the Court’s view he could not have been unaware, in view of the\\nlocal tensions and ongoing election campaign around that time, that his choice was\\nclearly not without certain potentially serious consequences.\\nHate speech and right of others to respect for private life\\nKaboğlu and Oran v. Turkey\\n30 October 2018\\nThis case concerned newspaper articles containing threats and hate speech against the\\napplicants, two university lecturers, attacking them for the ideas they had presented in a\\nreport addressed to the Government concerning questions of minority and cultural\\nrights. The applicants lost their cases before the domestic courts, which took the view\\nthat the offending articles fell within legislation protecting freedom of expression.\\nThe applicants complained that the national authorities had not protected them from the\\n27Factshe et – Hate speech\\ninsults, threats and hate speech directed against them in the press on account of the\\nideas they had expressed in their report.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention in respect of the applicants, finding that the domestic courts had\\nnot struck a fair balance between their right to respect for their private life and freedom\\nof the press. It considered, in particular, that the verbal attacks and threats of physical\\nharm made against the applicants sought to undermine their intellectual personality,\\ncausing them feelings of fear, anxiety and vulnerability in order to humiliate them and\\nbreak their will to defend their ideas. The Court also found that the domestic courts had\\nnot provided a satisfactory answer to the question of whether freedom of the press could\\njustify, in the circumstances of the case, the damage caused to the applicants’ right to\\nrespect for their private life by passages amounting to hate speech and incitement to\\nviolence, thus being likely to expose them to public contempt.\\nBeizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania\\n14 January 2020\\nThe applicants, two young men who were in a relationship, alleged that they had been\\ndiscriminated against on the grounds of sexual orientation because of the authorities’\\nrefusal to launch a pre-trial investigation into the hate comments on the Facebook page\\nof one of them. The latter had posted a photograph of them kissing on his Facebook\\npage, which led to hundreds of online hate comments. Some were about LGBT people in\\ngeneral, while others personally threatened the applicants. The applicants submitted that\\nthey had been discriminated against on the grounds of sexual orientation. They also\\nargued that the refusal had left them with no possibility of legal redress.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 14 (prohibition of\\ndiscrimination) taken in conjunction with Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the applicants had suffered discrimination on the grounds of\\ntheir sexual orientation and that the Lithuanian Government had not provided any\\njustification showing that the difference in treatment had been compatible with the\\nstandards of the Convention. It noted in particular that the applicants’ sexual orientation\\nhad played a role in the way they had been treated by the authorities, which had quite\\nclearly expressed disapproval of them so publicly demonstrating their homosexuality\\nwhen refusing to launch a pre-trial investigation. Such a discriminatory attitude had\\nmeant that the applicants had not been protected, as was their right under the criminal\\nlaw, from undisguised calls for an attack on their physical and mental integrity. The\\nCourt also held that there had been a violation of Article 13 (right to an effective\\nremedy) of the Convention because the applicants had been denied an effective\\ndomestic remedy for their complaints.\\nAssociation ACCEPT and Others v. Romania\\n1 June 2021\\nThis case concerned the interruption, by a group of about 50 people who entered the\\nvenue shouting homophobic remarks, insulting and threatening the participants, of the\\npublic screening of a movie portraying a same-sex family, organised by the applicant\\nassociation and attended by the other applicants. The investigation into the applicants’\\ncriminal complaint, for incitement to discrimination, abuse of office by restriction of\\nrights and the use of fascist, racist or xenophobic symbols in public, was discontinued by\\nthe prosecutor and their challenges thereto were unsuccessful.\\nThe Court held, inter alia, that there had been a violation of Article 14 (prohibition of\\ndiscrimination) taken in conjunction with Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of\\nthe Convention, in respect of the individual applicants, finding that the Romanian\\nauthorities had failed to discharge their positive obligation to investigate in an effective\\nmanner whether the verbal abuse directed towards the individual applicants constituted\\na criminal offence motivated by homophobia. In doing so, the authorities had shown\\ntheir own bias towards members of the LGBT community. The Court reiterated, in\\nparticular, that while being careful not to hold that each and every utterance of hate\\nspeech must, as such, attract criminal prosecution and criminal sanctions, comments\\n28Factshe et – Hate speech\\nthat amounted to hate speech and incitement to violence, and were thus clearly unlawful\\non the face of things, might in principle require the States to take certain positive\\nmeasures. Likewise, inciting hatred did not necessarily amount to a call for an act of\\nviolence or other criminal acts. Attacks on people committed by insulting, holding up to\\nridicule or slandering specific groups of the population could be sufficient for the\\nauthorities to favour combating racist speech in the form of freedom of expression\\nexercised in an irresponsible manner. The Court also emphasised that the necessity of\\nconducting a meaningful inquiry into the possibility that discriminatory motives had lain\\nbehind the abuse was absolute, given the hostility against the LGBT community in the\\nrespondent State and in the light of the evidence that homophobic slurs had been\\nuttered by the intruders during the incident. In the absence of such an inquiry,\\nprejudice-motivated crimes would inevitably be treated on an equal footing with cases\\nwithout such overtones, and the resultant indifference would be tantamount to official\\nacquiescence, or even connivance in, hate crimes.\\nValaitis v. Lithuania\\n17 January 2023\\nIn January 2018 the applicant published an essay on the Internet portal of a major daily\\nnewspaper, lrytas.lt, mentioning a finalist of the televised singing competition The Voice,\\nwho had publicly come out as homosexual. Twenty-one comments were posted in reply,\\ninsulting both the applicant and homosexuals, going so far as to suggest that\\nhomosexuals should be burnt in Auschwitz. Before the Court, the applicant submitted\\nthat the Lithuanian authorities had not taken effective measures to protect homosexuals\\nfrom hate speech.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 13 (right to an effective\\nremedy) of the Convention in respect of the applicant. It noted in particular that the\\nreopening of the investigation in the present case, following its judgment in the case\\nBeizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania (see above), had demonstrated a clear and positive\\nshift in the State authorities’ attitude towards the prosecution of hate crimes, who had\\ndrawn the necessary conclusions from that judgment. The Court did not find that the\\nreopened pre-trial investigation in the applicant’s case had been discontinued or\\nsuspended owing to a prejudicial attitude by the authorities. Although it had not led to\\nanyone being charged or convicted, it had not, on the whole, fallen short of the\\nrequirements under Article 13 of the Convention.\\nTexts and documents\\nSee, among others:\\n- Guide on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights –\\nFreedom of expression, prepared under the authority of the Jurisconsult\\n- Council of Europe Internet page on “Hate speech”\\nMedia Contact:\\nTel.: +33 (0)3 90 21 42 08\\n29',\n",

The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities,\\nmay be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed\\nby law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security,\\nterritorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the\\nprotection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for\\npreventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the\\nauthority and impartiality of the judiciary.”\\nIn its Grand Chamber judgment of 14 February 2023 delivered in the case Halet v.\\nLuxembourg, the European Court of Human Rights reiterated that the protection\\nenjoyed by whistle-blowers under Article 10 of the Convention was based on the need to\\ntake account of features that were specific to the existence of a work-based relationship:\\non the one hand, the duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion inherent in the subordinate\\nrelationship entailed by it, and, where appropriate, the obligation to comply with\\na statutory duty of secrecy; on the other hand, the position of economic vulnerability\\nvis-à-vis the person, public institution or enterprise on which they depended for\\nemployment and the risk of suffering retaliation from them.\\nThe Court also pointed out that, to date, the concept of “whistle-blower” had not been\\ngiven an unequivocal legal definition and that it had always refrained from providing\\nan abstract and general definition. Thus, the question of whether an individual who\\nclaimed to be a whistle-blower benefited from the protection offered by Article 10 of\\nthe Convention called for an assessment which took account of the circumstances of\\neach case and the context in which it occurred.\\nIn this connection, the Court decided to apply the review criteria defined by it in the\\nGuja v. Moldova judgment delivered by the Grand Chamber on 12 February 2008 in\\norder to assess whether and, if so, to what extent, an individual who discloses\\nconfidential information obtained in the context of an employment relationship could rely\\non the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. In addition, conscious of the\\ndevelopments which had occurred since the Guja judgment was adopted in 2008,\\nwhether in terms of the place now occupied by whistle blowers in democratic societies\\nand the leading role they are liable to play, the Court considered it appropriate to\\nconfirm and consolidate the principles established in its case-law with regard to the\\nprotection of whistle blowers, by refining the criteria for their implementation in the light\\nof the current European and international context.Factsheet – Whistleblowers and\\nfreedom to impart and to receive information\\nThe criteria thus defined are the following:\\n- the channels used to make the disclosure;\\n- the authenticity of the disclosed information;\\n- good faith;\\n- the public interest in the disclosed information;\\n- the detriment caused;\\n- the severity of the sanction.\\nGuja v. the Moldova\\n12 February 2008 (Grand Chamber judgment)\\nThe applicant, who was at the time the Head of the Press Department of the Moldovan\\nProsecutor General’s Office, complained about his dismissal from the Prosecutor\\nGeneral’s Office for divulging two documents which disclosed interference by a high-\\nranking politician in pending criminal proceedings.\\nIn this judgment, the Court identified for the first time the review criteria for assessing\\nwhether and to what extent an individual (in the given case, a public official) divulging\\nconfidential information obtained in his or her workplace could rely on the protection of\\nArticle 10 of the Convention. It also specified the circumstances in which the sanctions\\nimposed in response to such disclosures could interfere with the right to freedom of\\nexpression and amount to a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the\\npresent case. “Being mindful of the importance of the right to freedom of expression on\\nmatters of general interest, of the right of civil servants and other employees to report\\nillegal conduct and wrongdoing at their place of work, the duties and responsibilities of\\nemployees towards their employers and the right of employers to manage their staff,\\nand having weighed up the other different interests involved in the present case, the\\nCourt came to the conclusion that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom\\nof expression, in particular his right to impart information, was not ‘necessary in a\\ndemocratic society’” (§ 97 of the judgment).\\nMarchenko v. Ukraine\\n19 February 2009 (Chamber judgment)\\nIn 2001 the applicant, who was a teacher and the head of a trade union in the school\\nwhere he worked, was given a suspended sentence and a fine for publicly and\\nunfoundedly accusing the director of the school of misappropriating public funds.\\nHe complained of his conviction for defamation, as well as of having been found guilty of\\nan offence with which he had not been charged.\\nThe Court first recalled that the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal\\nconduct or wrongdoing in the workplace had to be protected. In the applicant’s case, it\\nfirst noted that, despite being a union representative acting on a matter of public\\nconcern, he had a duty to respect the reputation of others, including their presumption\\nof innocence, and owed loyalty and discretion to his employer. The Court further\\nobserved that the applicant should have made his allegations first to the director’s\\nsuperior, or other competent authority, before disclosing them to the public. It then\\nnoted that he had not attempted to use the legal means available to challenge what he\\nconsidered ineffective investigation by the public auditing service and the prosecutor into\\nhis allegations, but had instead accused the director harshly during a public picket.\\nThe Court therefore found that the applicant’s conviction for defamation was justified by\\nthe authorities as far as his picketing activities were concerned, because his accusations\\nhad lacked sufficient proof, could reasonably have been considered as defamatory and\\nhad undermined the director’s right to be presumed innocent until proven otherwise.\\nHaving had regard, however, to the fact that the domestic courts had sentenced the\\napplicant to a year in prison for these acts, the Court concluded that that had been an\\n2Factsheet – Whistleblowers and\\nfreedom to impart and to receive information\\nexcessive measure, which had had a dissuasive effect on public debate, in violation of\\nArticle 10 of the Convention.\\nKudeshkina v. Russia1\\n26 February 2009 (Chamber judgment)\\nThe applicant, a judge for more than 18 years, at the relevant time, held office at\\nMoscow City Court. She alleged that she had been dismissed from the judiciary in 2004\\nbecause she had publicly accused higher judicial and prosecution officials of putting\\npressure on her in connection with a high-profile criminal case.\\nHaving noted that the applicant had publicly criticised the conduct of various officials,\\nand had alleged that pressure on judges was common, the Court found that she had\\nundoubtedly raised a very important matter of public interest which had to be open to\\nfree debate in a democratic society. Even if she had allowed herself a certain degree of\\nexaggeration and generalisation, the Court found that the applicant’s statements had to\\nbe regarded as a fair comment on a matter of great public importance. Further, given\\nthe allegations the applicant had made against the President of Moscow City Court, the\\nCourt considered her fears concerning the impartiality of that court justified. As these\\narguments of hers had not been given consideration during the domestic proceedings,\\nthe Court also concluded that the manner in which the disciplinary sanction had been\\nimposed on the applicant had not secured important procedural guarantees. Finally, the\\nCourt noted that the penalty imposed, the applicant’s dismissal, had been capable of\\nhaving a “chilling effect” on judges wishing to participate in the public debate on the\\neffectiveness of the judicial institutions. The Court therefore held that that penalty had\\nbeen disproportionately severe, in violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nBalenović v. Croatia\\n30 September 2010 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of the applicant from her job in the national oil\\ncompany on account of statements in the press in which she had criticised certain\\naspects of the company’s business policy, disclosed certain inside information and\\naccused members of the company’s management of fraud.\\nThe Court declared the applicant’s complaints under Article 10 of the Convention\\ninadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, finding that, even though her dismissal\\nhad been a severe sanction for her behaviour, the interference complained of had not\\nbeen disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and thus could be regarded as\\n“necessary in a democratic society”. The Court reiterated in particular that Article 10 of\\nthe Convention did not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression and that the\\nexercise of this freedom carried with it “duties and responsibilities”. Therefore, whoever\\nexercised that freedom owed “duties and responsibilities”, the scope of which depended\\non his or her situation, the (technical) means he or she used and the authenticity of the\\ninformation disclosed to the public.\\nBathellier v. France\\n12 October 2010 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of the applicant, an employee of EDF-GDF, after he\\nhad written to the Prefect, denouncing the state of dilapidation of the electricity\\nnetworks and the risks to public safety.\\nThe Court declared the applicant’s complaints under Article 10 of the Convention\\ninadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, finding that the applicant had exceeded\\nthe permissible limit of his freedom of expression, in particular by exaggerating his\\nstatements and expressing personal considerations to the Prefect, and that the\\ninterference with his right to freedom of expression had therefore been “necessary in a\\ndemocratic society”.\\n1.

Germany\\n21 July 2011 (Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of a geriatric nurse after having brought a criminal\\ncomplaint against her employer alleging deficiencies in the care provided. The applicant\\ncomplained that her dismissal and the courts’ refusal to order her reinstatement had\\nviolated her right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the applicant’s dismissal without notice had been disproportionate and the domestic\\ncourts had failed to strike a fair balance between the need to protect the employer’s\\nreputation and the need to protect the applicant’s right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court noted in particular that, given the particular vulnerability of elderly patients\\nand the need to prevent abuse, the information disclosed had undeniably been of public\\ninterest. Further, the public interest in being informed about shortcomings in the\\nprovision of institutional care for the elderly by a State-owned company was so\\nimportant that it outweighed the interest in protecting a company’s business reputation\\nand interests. Finally, not only had the sanction imposed on the applicant had negative\\nrepercussions on her career, it was also liable to have a serious chilling effect both on\\nother company employees and on nursing-service employees generally, so discouraging\\nreporting in a sphere in which patients were frequently not capable of defending their\\nown rights and where members of the nursing staff would be the first to become aware\\nof shortcomings in the provision of care.\\nBargão and Domingos Correia v. Portugal\\n15 November 2012 (Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned the applicants’ conviction for aggravated defamation in respect of\\nan administrative assistant in a health centre, whom they had accused, in a letter sent to\\nthe Ministry of Health, of failing to comply with his working hours and of taking\\nadvantage of users’ vulnerability. The applicants alleged that their conviction had\\ninterfered with their right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the applicants’ conviction for aggravated defamation and the payment of damages\\nhad amounted to an interference which had not been “necessary in a democratic society”\\nto protect the reputation and rights of others. The Court noted in particular that the\\ndenunciations made by the applicants had not been made publicly or to a police body but\\nin a simple letter to the Ministry of Health, the body responsible for supervising public\\nhealth centres in Portugal. Moreover, the issues raised with the Ministry had been\\nlegitimate and in the public interest, namely the quality of the operation of a public\\nhealth centre and the violation of the law by a civil servant in the performance of his\\nduties. Moreover, the applicants had acted as citizens of the locality where the centre in\\nquestion was located. Finally, the abuse of power attributed by them to\\nthe administrative assistant constituted not only a disciplinary offence but also a serious\\ncrime under domestic law. The Court further observed that the domestic courts\\nhad failed to take into account the available evidence on the conduct of the\\nadministrative assistant.\\nBucur and Toma v. Romania\\n8 January 2013 (Chamber judgment)\\nThe first applicant, who worked for the Romanian Intelligence Service (RIS), had been\\nconvicted for divulging information classified “top secret”. He had released audio\\ncassettes at a press conference containing recordings of the telephone calls of several\\njournalists and politicians, together with incriminating elements he had noted down\\nin the register of conversations.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in\\nrespect of the first applicant, finding that the interference with his freedom of\\nexpression, and in particular with his right to impart information, had not been\\n“necessary in a democratic society”. As regards the question whether or not the\\n4Factsheet – Whistleblowers and\\nfreedom to impart and to receive information\\napplicant had other means of imparting the information, the Court noted in particular\\nthat no official procedure existed and that all he could do was inform his superiors of his\\nconcerns. But the irregularities he had discovered concerned them directly. It was\\ntherefore unlikely that any internal complaints he made would have led to an\\ninvestigation and put a stop to the unlawful practices concerned. Furthermore, civil\\nsociety was directly affected by the information concerned, as anyone’s telephone calls\\nmight be intercepted. In addition, the information the applicant had disclosed related to\\nabuses committed by high-ranking officials and affected the democratic foundations of\\nthe State. It thus concerned very important issues for the political debate in a\\ndemocratic society, in which public opinion had a legitimate interest. Concerning the\\naccuracy of the information made public, the Court also found that the applicant had had\\nreasonable grounds to believe that the information he divulged was true. As to the\\ndamage done to the RIS, the Court considered that the general interest in the disclosure\\nof information revealing illegal activities within the institution was so important in a\\ndemocratic society that it prevailed over the interest in maintaining public confidence in\\nthat institution. Lastly, there was no reason to believe that the applicant was driven by\\nany motive other than the desire to make a public institution abide by the laws of\\nRomania and in particular the Constitution. This was supported by the fact that he had\\nnot chosen to go to the press directly, in order to reach the broadest possible audience,\\nbut had first turned to a member of the parliamentary commission responsible for\\nsupervising the RIS.\\nLangner v. Germany\\n17 September 2015 (Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s dismissal from his job in a municipal housing office\\nafter accusing the deputy mayor of “perversion of justice” both orally at a staff meeting\\nand in subsequent written comments to the applicant’s hierarchical superior.\\nThe allegation had been made in relation to a demolition order the deputy mayor had\\nissued two years earlier. The applicant also alleged that the deputy mayor had unlawfully\\nattempted to dissolve the sub-division the applicant headed.\\nThe Court considered that the applicant’s case was not a “whistle-blowing” case that\\nwarranted special protection under Article 10 of the Convention. It noted in particular, in\\nthis regard, that instead of addressing his concerns about the deputy mayor’s decision to\\nthe mayor or the prosecuting authority, the applicant had raised them at a staff meeting\\nsome two years later. The Federal Labour Court had found that the applicant’s statement\\nhad not been aimed at uncovering an unacceptable situation within the Housing Office\\nbut was instead motivated by personal misgivings he had about the deputy mayor in\\nview of the impending dissolution of the applicant’s sub-division. In the present case,\\nthe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention,\\nfinding that here had not, therefore, been a disproportionate interference with the\\napplicant’s right to freedom of expression. Having regard to the above considerations\\nand, in particular, to the fact that the Federal Labour Court and the Labour Court of\\nAppeal had both carefully examined the case in the light of the applicant’s right to\\nfreedom of expression, the Court considered relevant and sufficient the domestic courts’\\nreasons for deciding that the applicant’s right to freedom of expression did not outweigh\\nthe public employer’s interest in his dismissal.\\nSee also: Catalan v. Romania, judgment (Chamber) of 9 January 2018, concerning the\\ndismissal of a civil servant, who worked for the National Council for the Study of\\nSecuritate Archives, for disclosing information for the publication of an article claiming\\nthat a religious leader had collaborated with the Securitate (the former political police\\nunder the communist regime): in this case, having regard to the duties and\\nresponsibilities of civil servants, the Court, after weighing up the various interests at\\nstake, found that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression had been\\nnecessary in a democratic society, and that there had therefore been no violation of\\nArticle 10 of the Convention.\\n5Factsheet – Whistleblowers and\\nfreedom to impart and to receive information\\nAurelian Oprea v. Romania\\n19 January 2016 (Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned proceedings brought against the applicant, an associate professor at\\nthe University of Agronomical Sciences and Veterinary Medicine – a State-financed\\nestablishment –, for defaming the deputy rector of that university at a press conference.\\nHe had in particular criticised him specifically for encouraging a plagiarised book, for his\\nmanagement of a programme of publicly funded scientific research and for accumulating\\ntoo many management positions. The applicant alleged that his freedom to express his\\nconcerns about education standards in Romanian universities had been breached.\\nThe Court did not consider the present case as a whistle-blower case. However,\\nit appreciated that the applicant’s reasons, as presented by the applicant himself, for the\\nimpugned statements were relevant for the assessment of the proportionality of the\\ninterference in the applicant’s exercise of his freedom of expression. Bearing in mind the\\nimportance of the right to freedom of expression on matters of general interest and\\nhaving weighed up the other different interests involved in the present case, the Court\\ncame to the conclusion that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of\\nexpression had not been “necessary in a democratic society” and held that there had\\ntherefore been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\\nSee also: Rubins v. Latvia, judgment (Chamber) of 13 January 2015, concerning the\\napplicant’s complaint that he had been dismissed from his post as Head of Department\\nat the Riga Stradina University for criticising the University management: in this case,\\nthe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, finding\\nthat the reasons relied on by the domestic courts, although relevant, had not been\\nsufficient to show that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of\\nexpression had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and, accordingly, had\\nnot been “necessary in a democratic society”.\\nGörmüs and Others v. Turkey\\n19 January 2016 (Chamber judgment)\\nIn April 2007 the Nokta weekly magazine published an article based on documents\\nclassified “confidential” by the Chief of Staff of the armed forces. The applicants –\\nrespectively, at the relevant time, the publishing director and editors-in-chief of the\\nweekly magazine as well as investigative journalists who worked for the publication –\\ncomplained that the measures taken by the relevant authorities, particularly the search\\nof their professional premises and the seizure of their documents, had been intended to\\nidentify their sources of information and infringed their right to freedom of expression,\\nespecially their right to receive or impart information as journalists.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the\\npresent case. Having regard especially to the importance of freedom of expression with\\nregard to matters of public interest and the need to protect journalistic sources in this\\narea, including where these sources were State employees who had observed and\\nreported potentially questionable conduct or practices in their workplaces, the Court,\\nhaving weighed up the various interests at stake and in particular the confidentiality of\\nmilitary affairs, held that the interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of\\nexpression, especially their right to impart information, did not meet a pressing social\\nneed, had not been proportionate to the legitimate aim sought and, in consequence,\\nhad not been “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court noted, in particular, that\\nthe impugned intervention was likely not only to have very negative repercussions on\\nthe applicants’ relationships with all of their sources, but could also have a serious\\nchilling effect in respect of other journalists or other whistle-blowers employed by the\\nState, and could discourage them from reporting any misconduct or controversial acts by\\npublic authorities.\\n6Factsheet – Whistleblowers and\\nfreedom to impart and to receive information\\nSoares v. Portugal\\n21 June 2016 (Chamber judgment)\\nAs a chief corporal in the National Republican Guard, the applicant had sent an email to\\nthe General Inspectorate of Internal Administration alleging that a Commander of a\\nterritorial post had been misusing public money. He claimed that his intention had been\\nto prompt an investigation into the allegations, which he admitted were based on a\\nrumour. The applicant complained about his conviction for aggravated defamation,\\nmaintaining that he had acted in good faith in disclosing the suspicion of alleged misuse\\nof public money within the National Republican Guard.\\nThe Court, noting in particular that the applicant’s case had to be distinguished from\\ncases of “whistle-blowing”, an action warranting special protection under Article 10 of\\nthe Convention, held that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention\\nin the present case. It considered that the reasons advanced by the domestic courts in\\nsupport of their decisions had been “relevant and sufficient” and that the interference\\nwith the applicant’s right to freedom of expression had not been disproportionate to the\\nlegitimate aim pursued, namely, the protection of reputation of others. The interference\\ncould thus be reasonably considered “necessary in a democratic society”, and the Court\\nsaw no serious reason to substitute its own assessment for that of the domestic courts,\\nwhich had examined the question at issue with care and in line with the principles laid\\ndown by the Court’s case-law.\\nMedžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n27 June 2017 (Grand Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned a finding of defamation in civil proceedings against four\\norganisations following the publication of a letter they had written to the highest\\nauthorities of their district complaining about a person’s application for the post of\\ndirector of Brčko District’s multi-ethnic radio and television station. Relying on their right\\nto freedom of expression, the applicants complained about the order to pay damages\\nimposed on them in the context of civil proceedings for defamation.\\nIn the absence of any issue of loyalty, reserve and discretion, the Court considered that,\\nin the present case, there was no need for it to enquire into the kind of issue which had\\nbeen central in its case-law on whistle-blowing, namely whether there existed any\\nalternative channels or other effective means for the applicants of remedying the alleged\\nwrongdoing (such as disclosure to the person’s superior or other competent authority or\\nbody) which the applicants intended to uncover. The Court held that there had been no\\nviolation of Article 10 of the Convention in the applicants’ case, as it was satisfied that\\nthe impugned interference had been supported by relevant and sufficient reasons and\\nhad been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. It found that the domestic\\nauthorities had struck a fair balance between the applicants’ freedom of expression, on\\nthe one hand, and the interest of the person concerned in protection of her reputation on\\nthe other hand, thus acting within their margin of appreciation.\\nGuja v. the Republic of Moldova (no. 2)\\n27 February 2018 (Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s allegation that he continued to be victimised as a\\nwhistle-blower, despite a previous ruling by the European Court in his favour (see above,\\nGuja v. Moldova, 12 February 2008). Following that judgment, the domestic courts had\\nordered his reinstatement in his former position. However, ten days after his\\nreinstatement he was given a dismissal order based on domestic law linked to the\\nappointment of a new Prosecutor General. His challenge to this new dismissal had since\\nfailed in the domestic courts. He complained that there had been no proper\\nreinstatement, and that this latest dismissal, and the rejection of his challenge to the\\nnew dismissal, amounted to a retaliation for his whistle-blowing back in 2003 and to a\\ndeliberate failure by the State to comply with the Court’s original judgment of 2008.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention,\\nfinding that the applicant’s second dismissal had violated his right to freedom\\n7Factsheet – Whistleblowers and\\nfreedom to impart and to receive information\\nof expression, in particular his right to impart information. The Court noted in particular\\nthat, despite purporting to abide by its earlier judgment, the Government of Moldova\\nhad never intended truly to reinstate the applicant. In reality, his second dismissal had\\nbeen a continued retributory measure in response to his whistle-blowing of 2003.\\nFurthermore, the domestic courts had contributed to the violation of the applicant’s\\nrights by refusing to examine his allegations and evidence, and by ignoring the principles\\nset out in the earlier Guja case.\\nHerbai v. Hungary\\n5 November 2019 (Chamber judgment)\\nThe applicant was working in the human resources department of a bank and was also\\ncontributing to a website which carried general articles about HR practice. The case\\nconcerned his dismissal from his job on the grounds that his website articles had\\nbreached the bank’s confidentiality standards and infringed its financial interests.\\nIn the absence of any wrongdoing which the applicant might have sought to uncover,\\nthe Court did not find it necessary to enquire into the kind of issues which had been\\ncentral to its case-law on whistle-blowing, but considered the following elements to be\\nrelevant when examining the permissible scope of the restriction of free speech in the\\nemployment relationship in the present case: the nature of the speech in question, the\\nmotives of the author, the damage, if any, caused by the speech to the employer, and\\nthe severity of the sanction imposed. It held that there had been a violation of\\nArticle 10 of the Convention in respect of the applicant, finding that the domestic courts\\nhad failed to carry out an adequate exercise to balance the applicant’s right to freedom\\nof expression against the bank’s right to protect its legitimate business interests.\\nIn particular, the Court disagreed with domestic court findings that articles on topics that\\nwere of interest to a professional audience could not benefit from free speech protection\\nsimply because they were not part of a debate of general public interest.\\nGawlik v. Liechtenstein\\n16 February 2021 (Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned a doctor who raised suspicions that euthanasia had been taking\\nplace in his hospital. In doing so, he went outside the hospital complaints structure and\\nlodged a criminal complaint. The affair attracted significant media attention.\\nThe applicant complained that his dismissal without notice from his post for lodging a\\ncriminal complaint had breached his rights.\\nIn this case, the Court stressed in particular that information disclosed by\\nwhistle-blowers might also be covered by Article 10 of the Convention under certain\\ncircumstances where the information in question was subsequently proved wrong or\\ncould not be proven correct. In particular, it could not reasonably be expected of\\na person having lodged a criminal complaint in good faith to anticipate whether the\\ninvestigations would lead to an indictment or be discontinued. However, in those\\ncircumstances, the person concerned must have complied with the duty to verify, to the\\nextent permitted by the circumstances, that the information was accurate and reliable.\\nThat approach was also reflected in relevant documents of the Council of Europe.\\nIn the applicant’s case, the Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with his rights had been proportionate.\\nWhile noting that he had not acted with improper motives, the Court nevertheless found\\nthat the applicant had been negligent in not verifying information. It therefore\\nconsidered that the applicant’s dismissal had been justified, especially given the effect\\non the hospital’s and another staff member’s reputations.\\nWojczuk v.

Luxembourg\\n14 February 2023 (Grand Chamber judgment)\\nThis case concerned the disclosure by the applicant, while he was employed by a private\\ncompany, of confidential documents protected by professional secrecy, comprising\\n14 tax returns of multinational companies and two accompanying letters, obtained from\\nhis workplace. Following a complaint by his employer, and at the close of criminal\\nproceedings against him, he was ordered by the Court of Appeal on appeal to pay a\\ncriminal fine of 1,000 euros, and to pay a symbolic sum of 1 euro in compensation for\\nthe non-pecuniary damage sustained by his employer. The applicant submitted that his\\ncriminal conviction had amounted to a disproportionate interference with his right to\\nfreedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the\\npresent case. In view, in particular, of its findings as to the importance, at both national\\nand European level, of the public debate on the tax practices of multinational companies,\\nto which the information disclosed by the applicant had made an essential contribution,\\nthe Court considered that the public interest in the disclosure of that information\\noutweighed all of the detrimental effects arising from it. Thus, after weighing up all the\\ninterests concerned and taken account of the nature, severity and chilling effect of the\\napplicant’s criminal conviction, the Court concluded that the interference with his right to\\nfreedom of expression, in particular his freedom to impart information, had not been\\n“necessary in a democratic society”.\\nHrachya Harutyunyan v. Armenia\\n27 August 2024 (Chamber judgment2)\\nThis case concerned the sending in March 2012 by the applicant of a report to the\\nmanagement of his former employer which he had just left, the Electric Networks of\\nArmenia (ENA). He alleged corruption on the part of a colleague who was still employed\\nat the company. Later, his report was disclosed to his former colleague, who sued him\\nsuccessfully for defamation and insult. The ENA was at the time the monopoly electricity\\nsupplier in the State and was Russian-owned. The applicant submitted that he had acted\\nas a whistle-blower when reporting his former colleague, whereas the domestic courts\\ntreated the case as a simple defamation case and imposed on him a substantial sum in\\ndamages for his report, which had been made in private.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention\\nin respect of the applicant. Having weighed up all the interests involved, it found that the\\ninterference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression, in the present case, had\\nnot been “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court noted, in particular, that the\\ndomestic courts had treated the present case as an ordinary defamation dispute. In this\\nregard, although the applicant had not specifically relied on the protection of freedom of\\nexpression afforded to whistle-blowers, he had raised a number of arguments pertaining\\nto the criteria applicable in whistle blower cases and thus had given the national courts\\nan opportunity to rule on his case from that perspective. The Court also observed that\\nthe applicant had not reported t‑he alleged acts of misconduct to competent State\\nauthorities or the press; he had opted for the internal channels of reporting and had\\nsubmitted his report to the hierarchy of his former employer following the latter’s call for\\npeople to come forward with such information on the promise that all reports would\\n2.

Relying on their right\\nto freedom of expression, the applicants complained about the order to pay damages\\nimposed on them in the context of civil proceedings for defamation.\\nThe Grand Chamber held, by eleven votes to six, that there had been no violation of\\nArticle 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention. The Grand Chamber found in\\nparticular that four statements in the letter contained allegations portraying the\\ncandidate in question as a person who was disrespectful and contemptuous in her\\nopinions and sentiments about Muslims and ethnic Bosniacs. The nature of the\\naccusations had been such as to seriously call into question her suitability for the post of\\ndirector of the radio and her role as editor of the entertainment programme of a multi-\\nethnic public radio station. However, the applicants had not established before the\\ndomestic courts the truthfulness of these statements which they knew or ought to have\\nknown were false despite being bound by the requirement to verify the veracity of their\\nallegations even if these had been disclosed to the authorities by means of private\\ncorrespondence. The Grand Chamber therefore held that the applicants had not had a\\nsufficient factual basis to support their allegations and that the interference with their\\nfreedom of expression had been supported by relevant and sufficient reasons and had\\nbeen proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (protection of the reputation of the\\ncandidate in question). The Court also held that the domestic authorities had struck a\\nfair balance between the applicants’ freedom of expression and the candidate’s interest\\nin the protection of her reputation, thus acting within their margin of appreciation.\\nGRA Stiftung Gegen Rassismus und Antisemitismus v.

The Court noted in particular that the context of\\nthe debate at the time of the referendum – including other criticisms of the referendum\\nitself by human rights bodies – meant that the organisation’s use of the words “verbal\\nracism” had not been without factual foundation. The penalty imposed on the\\norganisation might also have had a chilling effect on its freedom of expression.\\nMargulev v.

It first noted that although the applicant was a third-party to the dispute\\nrather than the direct object of the defamation proceedings, he could still claim to be a\\nvictim of an alleged violation of his right to freedom of expression.

The book had openly raised the issue of the responsibility of the party and its\\nchairman in the development of racism in France and the difficulty of combating this\\nscourge. The applicants argued that their criminal conviction had entailed a violation of\\ntheir freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in respect of the conviction of the first two applicants and of the third.\\nIt observed in particular that the sanctions imposed on the author and publisher had not\\nconcerned the argument underlying the impugned work but three specific passages from\\nthe novel. The convictions had thus been based on relevant and sufficient grounds and\\nthe sanctions had not been disproportionate. As to the third applicant, he had\\noverstepped the permissible limits of “provocation” by reproducing the offending\\npassages from the novel in a widely-read national daily newspaper, also taking into\\nconsideration the need to protect the reputation of a named person and the rights of\\nothers. The fine imposed on him and the damages awarded had been moderate.\\nIleana Constantinescu v.

The Court noted in particular\\nthat at least part of the impugned remarks had been made in the context of a debate of\\ngeneral interest to the community of Romanian economists. In addition, the remarks did\\nnot concern aspects of the private life of the person concerned, but conduct concerning\\nhis professional activities and involvement in an association. Lastly, whilst the applicant\\nhad not been able to prove before the domestic courts that her allegations had a\\nsufficient factual basis, her conduct when examined as a whole showed that she had\\nacted in good faith, being convinced that there was a problem of professional ethics.\\n2.

They complained that their convictions had violated their right to\\nfreedom of expression.\\nIn both cases the Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom\\nof expression) of the Convention, finding that the Finnish courts had struck a fair balance\\nbetween the competing interests at stake. The Court noted in particular that admittedly\\nthe prime minister was a public figure and the book contained material of public interest,\\nbut only the passages concerning intimate life had been considered in assessing the\\ndamage caused to his reputation.\\nAlmeida Leitão Bento Fernandes v. Portugal\\n12 March 2015\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant for libelling a number of her\\nin-laws, following publication of a novel relating family dramas in the context of the\\nPortuguese diaspora in the United States and the colonial war. The applicant complained\\nthat her conviction for libelling her husband’s family and tarnishing their honour had\\ninfringed her right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the interference with the exercise by the applicant of her\\nfreedom of expression had not been disproportionate with regard to the legitimate aim\\npursued, namely the protection of the reputation and rights of others. The Court agreed\\nwith the Portuguese courts that the applicants had overstepped the limits of her freedom\\nof artistic creativity by disregarding the right of her in-laws to respect for their private\\nlife, on account of certain events narrated and value judgments made. It considered, in\\nparticular, that the room for manoeuvre (margin of appreciation) given to the authorities\\nin assessing the necessity of the punishment imposed on the applicant was a wide one\\nbecause the persons concerned were not public figures.\\nMarinoni v. Italy\\n18 November 2021\\nThis case concerned a finding of civil liability against the author of a book on account of\\ntwo sets of remarks deemed by the Italian courts to be defamatory. The book included a\\nreconstruction of the events preceding the summary execution of 43 captured soldiers of\\nthe Italian Social Republic (an episode known as the “strage di Rovetta”). The historical\\naccount was overlaid with the author’s private and personal recollections centred on his\\nfamily life. The applicant was acquitted in the criminal proceedings at first instance but\\nwas found civilly liable following an appeal by the civil parties. He argued that the\\ndecisions of the domestic courts had infringed his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression,\\nnamely the finding of civil liability against him, had had been aimed at the “protection of\\nthe reputation or rights of others” and had not been disproportionate. The Court\\nobserved in particular that the book, which combined the author’s personal recollections\\nwith material obtained through his research in the archives, fell into a specific category\\nof historical research known as “microhistory”. The domestic courts had taken this\\naspect into consideration in their assessment of the book. As to the two sets of remarks,\\nthe Court found that the first was not justified in the public interest and that the second\\ndid not add anything to the reconstruction of events surrounding the “strage di Rovetta”.\\nThe Court also held that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 2 (presumption of\\ninnocence) of the Convention in the present case.\\n4Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nDoctors and health workers\\nFrankowicz v. Poland\\n16 December 2008\\nThe applicant was a gynaecologist and the President of the Association for the Protection\\nof the Rights of Patients in Poland. He complained about disciplinary proceedings brought\\nagainst him for a report he had prepared on the treatment of a patient in which he was\\ncritical of another doctor, following which he had been sanctioned by the Medical Court\\nand given a reprimand.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression\\nhad not been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely protecting the\\nreputation of others. It observed in particular that, in the applicant’s case, the Polish\\nauthorities had concluded, without having attempted to verify the truthfulness of the\\nfindings in the medical opinion, that the applicant had discredited another doctor. That\\ndecision was made on the basis of the absolute prohibition in Poland on any criticism\\nbetween doctors. The Court considered that that absolute prohibition was likely to\\ndiscourage doctors from providing their patients with an objective opinion on their health\\nand any treatment received, which could compromise the very purpose of the medical\\nprofession, namely to protect the health and life of patients.\\nHeinisch v. Germany\\n21 July 2011\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of a geriatric nurse after having brought a criminal\\ncomplaint against her employer alleging deficiencies in the care provided. The applicant\\ncomplained that her dismissal and the courts’ refusal to order her reinstatement had\\nviolated her right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the applicant’s dismissal without notice had been\\ndisproportionate and the German courts had failed to strike a fair balance between the\\nneed to protect the employer’s reputation and the need to protect the applicant’s right to\\nfreedom of expression. The Court observed in particular that, given the particular\\nvulnerability of elderly patients and the need to prevent abuse, the information disclosed\\nhad undeniably been of public interest. Further, the public interest in being informed\\nabout shortcomings in the provision of institutional care for the elderly by a State-owned\\ncompany was so important that it outweighed the interest in protecting a company’s\\nbusiness reputation and interests.\\nÄrztekammer Für Wien and Dorner v. Austria\\n16 February 2016\\nThe applicants in this case, namely the Vienna Chamber of Medical Doctors and its\\npresident at the time of the events, complained about decisions by the Austrian courts\\nprohibiting them from making certain negative statements about a private company,\\nwhich was planning to provide radiology services. These decisions followed a complaint\\nby the company regarding a letter published by the second applicant on the Chamber’s\\nwebsite, referring in particular to the company as a “locust” company or fund.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in respect of the second applicant, finding that the interference with\\nthe exercise of his right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society\\nin order to protect the reputation and rights of the company in question.

In doing so, he went outside the hospital complaints structure and\\n5Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nlodged a criminal complaint. The affair attracted significant media attention.\\nThe applicant complained that his dismissal without notice from his post for lodging a\\ncriminal complaint had breached his rights.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s rights had been\\nproportionate. While noting that he had not acted with improper motives, the Court\\nnevertheless found that the applicant had been negligent in not verifying information.\\nIn the present case, it considered that the applicant’s dismissal had been justified,\\nespecially given the effect on the hospital’s and another staff member’s reputations.\\nEmployees\\nMarunić v. Croatia\\n28 March 2017\\nThe applicant, the director of a municipal company providing public utility services, was\\nsummarily dismissed from her post after making statements to the media defending\\nherself a week after the company chairman had publicly criticised her work in a press\\narticle. The decision to dismiss her was taken on the grounds that she had made\\nallegations to the press that were damaging to the company’s reputation. The applicant\\ncomplained that her statements to the media had only been made with a view to\\ndenying the false accusations against her, and that her dismissal had been in breach of\\nher right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression\\nin the form of her summary dismissal had not been necessary in a democratic society to\\nprotect the reputation and rights of the company. The Court noted in particular that,\\nwhile a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion normally prevented employees from\\npublicly criticising the work of their employers, crucially in the applicant’s case it was\\nanother officer of the company who was the first to resort to the media and to publicly\\ncriticise the applicant’s work. In such specific circumstances the applicant could not have\\nbeen expected to remain silent and not to defend her reputation in the same way.\\nIt would be to overstretch her duty of loyalty to require otherwise.\\nWojczuk v. Poland\\n9 December 2021\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, who was employed by the Museum\\nof Hunting and Horse-riding, for libel against the museum for four anonymous letters\\nallegedly sent by him which were critical of the museum’s management. The applicant\\nsubmitted that his criminal conviction had been disproportionate and unjustified.\\nThe Court accepted, in particular, that the interference with the applicant’s exercise of\\nhis right to freedom of expression, namely his criminal conviction for libel, had pursued\\nthe legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others – namely, the good\\nname of the museum, as well as its director and other members of the management.\\nIn the present case, it held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of\\nexpression) of the Convention, finding that the Polish courts had adduced sufficient and\\nrelevant reasons to justify the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression.\\nAllée v. France\\n18 January 20243\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant, who was employed as a\\nsecretary in a faith-based educational association at the relevant time, for public\\ndefamation following her allegations of harassment and sexual assault against a senior\\nexecutive of the association in question. The claims had been sent by email to six people\\nfrom both inside and outside the association.\\n3. This judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 (final judgments) of the\\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\\n6Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that there had been no reasonable relationship of proportionality\\nbetween the restriction on the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and the\\nlegitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of reputation and rights of others. It\\nstressed, in particular, the need, under Article 10, to provide appropriate protection to\\nindividuals alleging that they had been subjected to mental or sexual harassment. In the\\npresent case, the Court considered that the domestic courts’ refusal to adapt the concept\\nof sufficient factual basis and the criteria for assessing good faith to the circumstances of\\nthe case had placed an excessive burden of proof on the applicant, by requiring that she\\nprovide evidence of the acts she wished to report. The Court also noted that the email,\\nsent by the applicant to six people of whom only one had been an external party, had\\nhad only a minor impact on her alleged harasser’s reputation. Lastly, although the\\nfinancial penalty imposed on the applicant could not be described as particularly severe,\\nshe had nonetheless been convicted of a criminal offence. By its nature, such a\\nconviction had a chilling effect, which could discourage people from reporting such\\nserious actions as those amounting, in their view, to mental or sexual harassment,\\nor even sexual assault.\\nHistorians\\nKarsai v. Hungary\\n1 January 2009\\nIn 2004 there was a public debate in Hungary as to whether a statue should be set up to\\ncommemorate the former Prime Minister Pál Teleki, who had cooperated with Nazi\\nGermany and had been involved in the passing of anti-Semitic legislation. The applicant,\\nwho was a Hungarian historian and university professor, published an article criticising\\nthe right-wing press, and one journalist in particular, for praising Pál Teleki’s role and for\\nmaking anti-Semitic statements. He complained in particular that he had been ordered\\nto publish a rectification at his expense and to bear considerable legal costs.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the Hungarian courts had not convincingly established any\\npressing social need for putting the personality rights of a participant in a public debate\\nabove the applicant’s right to freedom of expression. It noted in particular that the\\napplicant’s article had been published in the course of a public debate of the utmost\\npublic interest. Moreover, the journalist in question had voluntarily exposed himself to\\npublic criticism by publishing articles in the popular daily press as part of that debate.\\nLastly, the sanction imposed on the applicant, namely the duty to retract in a matter\\nwhich affected his professional credibility as a historian, was capable of producing a\\nchilling effect.\\nBraun v. Poland\\n4 November 2014\\nThis case concerned the complaint by a film director and historian about being ordered\\nto pay a fine and to publish an apology for having damaged the reputation of a\\nwell-known professor to whom he had referred, in a radio debate, as an informant of the\\nsecret political police during the communist era. The applicant complained that the Polish\\ncourts’ decisions had violated his right to freedom of expression, arguing in particular\\nthat he had been active as a journalist for many years and that radio debate in which he\\nparticipated concerned an important matter relating to a public figure.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It noted in particular that the applicant had made a serious accusation\\nagainst the professor which constituted an attack on his reputation. However, when\\nfaced with the task of balancing the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and the\\nprofessor’s right to respect for his reputation, the Polish courts had made a distinction\\nbetween the standards applicable to journalists and those applicable to other participants\\nin the public debate. Under the Polish Supreme Court’s case law, the standard of due\\n7Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\ndiligence and good faith was to be applied only to journalists, while others, as the\\napplicant, were required to prove the veracity of their allegations. Since he had been\\nunable to prove the truth of his statement, the courts had concluded that he had\\nbreached the professor’s personal rights. The Court was however unable to accept the\\napproach of the Polish courts which had required the applicant to prove the veracity of\\nhis allegations and thus to fulfil a higher standard than that required from journalists.\\nPinto Pinheiro Marques v. Portugal\\n22 January 2015\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, a historian and the chairman of a\\ncultural association, for damaging the reputation of a municipal council with which he\\nhad signed an agreement regarding publication of the works of a poet from the region.\\nAn initial volume was published in 2003. In 2005 the council published another book on\\nthe poet’s works. The applicant, who considered that the council had acted wrongfully in\\npublishing the book on its own initiative, had an article published in a regional\\nnewspaper for which he was subsequently punished for insulting a legal entity exercising\\npublic authority. His appeal against the decision was dismissed. Before the Court, the\\napplicant complained about his conviction for defamation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that, even though they had been relevant, the grounds put\\nforward by the Portuguese Government did not suffice to establish that the impugned\\ninterference was necessary in a democratic society and that there was no reasonable\\nrelationship of proportionality between the restriction of the applicant’s right to freedom\\nof expression as a result of his conviction and the legitimate aim pursued, namely the\\nprotection of the credibility and honour of the municipal council and the citizens’ trust in\\nthat institution. The Court found in particular that the applicant’s comments had not\\nexceeded the limits of permissible criticism under Article 10 of the Convention. The limits\\nof permissible criticism were wider with regard to a public institution than in relation to a\\nprivate citizen, or even a politician, especially where the institution had executive\\nauthority, as in the present case. In a democratic system its actions or omissions must\\nbe subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also\\nof the press and public opinion.\\nJournalists and publishing companies\\nRadio France and Others v. France\\n30 March 2004\\nThis case concerned the conviction of radio journalists following the broadcasting on the\\nradio over a twenty-four-hour period of a number of bulletins attributing to a former\\nsous-préfet an active personal role in the deportation of a thousand Jews in 1942. The\\napplicants complained in particular of a violation of their right to impart information as a\\nresult of the sanctions and measures imposed on them by the French courts.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the measures taken against the applicants had not been\\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the reputation\\nor rights of others, and could therefore be considered necessary in a democratic society.\\nAs to the disputed broadcasts in particular, they admittedly quoted from a detailed and\\nwell-documented article and interview published in a reputable weekly magazine.\\nHowever, they alleged that the former sous-préfect had admitted “having organised\\nthe departure of a convoy of deportees to Drancy”. According to the Court, that\\nallegation did not accurately reflect the published article or interview. Moreover,\\nalthough the broadcasts were subsequently slightly amended, and pointed out that the\\nperson concerned denied the allegations, the original bulletin was nonetheless broadcast\\nseveral times.\\n8Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nChauvy and Others v. France\\n29 June 2004\\nThe applicants in this case were a journalist and writer, a publishing company and the\\npresident of that company. In 1997 the company published a book by the first applicant\\nentitled Aubrac-Lyons 1943, which recounts the arrest by Klaus Barbie of the main\\nResistance leaders in Caluire, including Jean Moulin and Raymond Aubrac. Following a\\ncomplaint by Raymond and Lucie Aubrac, the applicants were found guilty of criminal\\nlibel and ordered, inter alia, to pay a fine and damages. They submitted that their\\nconviction had infringed their right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the interference with the applicants’ freedom of\\nexpression had not been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely to\\nprotect the Aubracs from damage to their reputation. Noting in particular that the quest\\nfor historical truth was an integral part of freedom of expression, the Court considered\\nthat it was not its task to settle the substantive historical issue, which was part of an\\nongoing debate among historians and even public opinion about the events and their\\ninterpretation. However, in order to determine whether the measure in question had\\nbeen necessary in a democratic society, the Court had to balance the public interest in\\nknowing the circumstances of Jean Moulin’s arrest against the requirement of protecting\\nthe reputation of Mr and Mrs Aubrac, who had themselves been major figures of\\nthe Resistance.\\nCumpănă and Mazăre v. Romania\\n17 December 2004 (Grand Chamber)\\nThe applicants, a journalist and the editor of a local newspaper, had written an article\\nabout the management of the local city council’s finances, accusing a council official and\\nthe deputy mayor of certain criminal offences and depicting them in a cartoon as\\nrejoicing in their misdeeds. The official in question lodged a criminal complaint alleging\\ninsult and defamation. The applicants complained that their freedom of expression had\\nbeen infringed on account of their criminal conviction following the publication of\\nthe article.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention finding that, although the interference with the applicants’ right to\\nfreedom of expression might have been justified by the concern to restore the balance\\nbetween the various competing interests at stake (the right to impart ideas and facts\\nand the protection of the reputation of representatives of the public authorities), the\\ncriminal sanction and the accompanying prohibitions imposed on them had been\\nmanifestly disproportionate in their nature and severity to the legitimate aim pursued. In\\nthis case the Court pointed out in particular that, while the press had a duty to inform\\nthe public about presumed misappropriation on the part of local elected representatives\\nand public officials, the fact of directly accusing specified individuals by mentioning their\\nnames and positions gave rise to an obligation to provide a sufficient factual basis.\\nMoreover, when exercising their freedom of expression, journalists were required to act\\nin good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the\\nethics of journalism. That had not been the case in this instance. However, in regulating\\nthe exercise of freedom of expression so as to ensure adequate protection by law of\\nindividuals’ reputations, States should avoid taking measures that might deter the media\\nfrom fulfilling their role of alerting the public to apparent or suspected misuse of public\\npower. In addition, investigative journalists were liable to be inhibited from reporting on\\nmatters of public interest if they ran the risk, as one of the standard sanctions imposable\\nfor unjustified attacks on the reputation of private individuals, of being sentenced to\\nprison or to a prohibition on the exercise of their profession.\\n9Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nKatamadze v. Georgia\\n14 February 2006 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, a journalist, following the publication\\nof an editorial criticising the founder and editor and three journalists of another local\\nnewspaper. They had complained that the applicant had been spreading rumours\\nthrough the press and that the expressions used in the impugned article undermined\\ntheir dignity and reputation.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. Since\\nthe complainants had objectively shown that the impugned allegations were capable of\\ninterfering with their rights, the fact that domestic law required the applicant to adduce\\nevidence as to the veracity of her statements did not in particular seem in itself to run\\ncounter to Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention. The applicant had\\nhowever been unable to show that it had not been a gratuitous personal attack with\\npointlessly harmful comments. The finding against her had therefore been a necessary\\nmeasure in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others.\\nMoreover, having regard to the public insult to those individuals, without any valid\\njustification, the penalty imposed did not appear excessively harsh.\\nLeempoel & S.A. ED. Ciné Revue v. Belgium\\n9 November 2006\\nThe applicants were a publishing company and its publisher. The case concerned the\\nwithdrawal from sale and the prohibition on distribution of an issue of the magazine Ciné\\nTélé Revue which had published notes prepared by an investigating judge for a hearing\\nbefore the parliamentary commission of inquiry into the Dutroux case4. The applicants\\nsubmitted that the ruling against them had infringed their right to freedom of\\nexpression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the article in question and its circulation could not be\\nregarded as having contributed to any debate of general interest to society, and that the\\ngrounds given by the Belgian courts to justify the applicants’ conviction had been\\nrelevant and sufficient. The impugned interference had thus been proportionate to the\\naim pursued, namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others, and necessary\\nin a democratic society. In that case the Court observed in particular that, while there\\nwas a right of the public to be informed – an essential right in a democratic society\\nwhich, in particular circumstances, could even concern aspects relating to the private life\\nof public figures – publications with the sole aim of satisfying the curiosity of a\\ncertain readership about the details of someone’s private life, however famous that\\nperson might be, could not be regarded as contributing to any debate of general interest\\nfor society.\\nTønsbergs Blad AS and Haukom v. Norway\\n1 March 2007\\nThis case concerned orders against the applications – the publisher and editor-in-chief of\\na newspaper – to pay compensation and costs as a result of a newspaper article\\nidentifying a leading industrialist as being on a list of householders suspected of\\ncontravening local regulations\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the reasons relied on by the Norwegian authorities,\\nalthough relevant, had not been sufficient to show that the interference complained of\\nhad been necessary in a democratic society. There had been no reasonable relationship\\nof proportionality between the restrictions on the applicants’ right to freedom of\\nexpression and the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the rights and\\nreputation of the industrialist. In this regard, the Court noted in particular that the article\\n4 The “Dutroux case” led to the prosecution of a number of suspected paedophiles in Belgium in the 1990s. In\\n2004 the main defendant, Marc Dutroux, was found guilty of having abducted, held captive, raped and\\nmurdered several young girls and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\\n10Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nhad not set out to damage the industrialist’s reputation, but to illustrate a problem which\\nthe public had an interest in being informed about. Nor did the article relate exclusively\\nto his private life, as it concerned a possible failure by a public figure to observe laws\\nand regulations whose purpose was to protect serious public interests, albeit in the\\nprivate sphere.\\nColaço Mestre and SIC - Sociedade Independente de Comunicação S.A. v.\\nPortugal\\n26 April 2007\\nThis case concerned the conviction for defamation of the applicants – a journalist and\\nthe company which employed him and to which belonged the national television channel\\nSIC – on account of remarks made by the journalist during an interview with the then\\nGeneral Secretary of UEFA and broadcast by SIC in a television programme. The\\ninterview focussed on allegations concerning bribery of referees in Portugal and the\\nactions of the then President of the Portuguese Professional Football League and\\nChairman of the football club FC Porto.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. Taking into account, in particular, all the aspects of the case, it found\\nthat a fair balance had been struck in the case between the need to protect the\\napplicants’ rights to freedom of expression and that of protecting the rights and\\nreputation of the complainant. It noted among other things that the latter was well\\nknown to the general public and played a major role in Portuguese public life. Moreover,\\nthe interview had not concerned his private life but solely his public activities as\\nChairman of a leading football club and President of the League. Lastly, the Court found\\nthat the punishment of a journalist by sentencing him to pay a fine, together with an\\naward of damages against him and the television channel employing him, might\\nseriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest\\nand should not be envisaged unless there were particularly strong reasons for doing so.\\nIn those circumstances, whilst the reasons advanced by the Portuguese courts to justify\\nthe applicants’ conviction might be regarded as relevant, they were not, however,\\nsufficient and, accordingly, did not serve to meet a pressing social need.\\nLindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France\\n22 October 2007 (Grand Chamber)\\nSee above, under “Authors and publishers of books”.\\nMihaiu v. Romania\\n4 November 2008\\nA journalist, the applicant was sentenced to a criminal fine for defamation and ordered to\\npay damages for publishing an article in which he claimed that another journalist had\\naccepted a luxury wrist-watch from the an industrial group during a press conference\\norganised by the group, which – according to the article in question – had brought about\\nthe insolvency of one of Romania’s biggest businesses. The applicant submitted in\\nparticular that his conviction for defamation had resulted in a violation of his right to\\nfreedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the applicant’s conviction had not been disproportionate\\nto the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the reputation of others, and\\nthat the impugned interference could therefore be deemed necessary in a democratic\\nsociety. The Court considered in particular that in levelling a direct accusation at a\\nparticular person, specifying his name and occupation, the onus had been on the\\napplicant to provide a sufficient factual basis in the proceedings against him. In the\\npresent case, however, the Court was not convinced of the applicant’s alleged good faith.\\nOn the contrary, it considered that when repeating statements attributed to third parties,\\nthe applicant should have exercised the utmost rigour and special care before publishing\\nthe article. Accordingly, in the absence of good faith and any factual basis, and although\\nthe article in question had been published in the context of a broader and highly topical\\n11Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\ndebate in Romania, namely, the independence of the press, the Court did not discern in\\nthe applicant’s comments the expression of a degree of exaggeration or provocation that\\nwere covered by journalistic licence.\\nStandard Verlags GmbH v. Austria (no. 2)\\n4 June 2009\\nThis case concerned the conviction for defamation of the applicant publishing company\\narising out of the publication of an article in a daily newspaper owned by the applicant\\ncommenting on rumours that the wife of the then Austrian President intended to divorce\\nand had close contacts with two men, an Austrian politician and a foreign ambassador.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention in the present case. Considering that even public figures could\\nlegitimately expect to be protected against the propagation of rumours relating to\\nintimate aspects of their private life, it found that the interference in question had been\\nnecessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of\\nothers. Furthermore, the measures imposed on the applicant company had not been\\ndisproportionate.\\nKuliś and Różycki v. Poland\\n6 October 2009\\nThe first applicant in this case owned a publishing house which published a weekly\\nmagazine and a supplement for children. The second applicant was the magazine’s\\neditor-in-chief. The case concerned the publication in the supplement of an article\\ncontaining satirical cartoons which referred to an advertising campaign for potato crisps\\nmarketed by a food manufacturer and aimed at children. The applicants complained that\\nthe sanction imposed on them for having published the cartoon was not justified.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the reasons adduced by the Polish courts could not be\\nregarded as relevant and sufficient to justify the interference, which had been\\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the reputation\\nor rights of others. It noted in particular that the applicants’ primary aim had not been to\\ndenigrate the quality of the crisps but to raise awareness of the type of slogans used by\\nthe manufacturer and the unacceptability of such tactics to generate sales. Moreover, in\\nperforming its duty to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest, the\\npress was entitled to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation.\\nWhile the wording employed by the applicants had been exaggerated, this had only been\\nin reaction to an advertising campaign which had displayed a lack of sensitivity and\\nunderstanding for the age and vulnerability of children. The style of the applicants’\\nexpression had thus been motivated by the type of slogans to which they were reacting\\nand, in the context, had not overstepped the boundaries permissible to a free press.\\nRuokanen and Others v. Finland\\n6 April 2010\\nThe applicants were an editor-in-chief and a journalist and a publishing company.\\nThey complained about their conviction of defamation following publication of an article\\nstating that a student had been raped in September 2000 by members of a baseball\\nteam at a party to celebrate their victory in the Finnish championship. The applicants\\nhad been ordered to pay over 80,000 euros in damages to compensate each member of\\nthe baseball team.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the domestic courts had struck a fair balance between the\\ncompeting interests involved, i.e. the applicants’ right to freedom of expression and the\\nright to reputation of the alleged perpetrators of a crime. It observed in particular that\\nimperatives other than matters of public concern had to be weighed up before an\\nincident was reported by the media to the public as fact. The right to presumption of\\ninnocence and reputation of third parties was of equal importance especially where\\nserious accusations of sexual misconduct were concerned.\\n12Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nBrunet Lecomte and Lyon Mag’ v. France\\n6 May 2010\\nThe applicants were the publication director and publisher of a news magazine.\\nThey complained about their conviction for defamation following the publication, in an\\narticle about the Islamist networks in Lyons, of allegations insinuating that a Muslim\\nprofessor had taken part in terrorist activities.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that such a penalty had been disproportionate and that the\\ninterference in the exercise by the applicants of their right to freedom of expression had\\nnot therefore been necessary in a democratic society. The Court observed in particular\\nthat the offending remarks were not devoid of factual basis and that, in view of the\\nquantity and seriousness of the sources consulted, the investigation carried out and the\\nmoderation and prudence shown in the article, the applicants had been acting in good\\nfaith. Furthermore, the offending articles, published shortly after the 11 September 2001\\nattacks, had contributed to a political debate of immediate interest, resituating it in the\\nlocal context. Therefore, the applicants’ interest in imparting and the public’s interest in\\nreceiving information about a subject in the general interest, and its repercussions for\\nthe Lyons area as a whole, had prevailed over the right of the professor concerned to the\\nprotection of his reputation.\\nUj v. Hungary\\n19 July 2011\\nA journalist, the applicant complained about his conviction for libel for harshly criticising\\nthe quality of a well-known variety of Hungarian wine, produced by a State-owned\\ncompany, in a national daily newspaper. The Hungarian courts found that although the\\napplicant was entitled to express his opinion about the wine, characterising it as “shit”\\nwas unduly insulting and had infringed the wine producer’s right to a good reputation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the necessity for interfering with the applicant’s freedom of\\nexpression had not been convincingly justified. It noted in particular that there was a\\ndifference between damaging an individual’s reputation concerning his or her social\\nstatus, with the repercussions that that could have on his or her dignity, and a\\ncompany’s commercial reputation, which had no moral dimension. In addition, the article\\nhad expressed a value judgment or opinion whose primary aim was to raise awareness\\nabout the disadvantages of State ownership rather than to denigrate the quality of the\\ncompany’s products. Lastly, raising as it did the question of government policies on the\\nprotection of national values and the role of private enterprise and foreign investment, it\\nconcerned a matter of public interest in respect of which the press had a duty to impart\\ninformation and ideas, even if exaggerated or provocative. Since the domestic courts\\nhad failed to have regard to these considerations, Hungary could not establish that the\\nrestriction had been proportionate.\\nAxel Springer AG v. Germany\\n7 February 2012 (Grand Chamber)\\nThe applicant company is the publisher of a national daily newspaper with a\\nlarge-circulation which in September 2004 published a front-page article about the star\\nof a popular television series who had been arrested at the Munich beer festival for\\npossession of cocaine. The article was supplemented by a more detailed article on\\nanother page. Immediately after that article appeared, the actor obtained an injunction\\nrestraining any further publication of the article. The applicant company complained\\nabout the injunction imposed on it against reporting on the arrest and conviction of the\\nactor in question.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the restrictions imposed on the applicant company had not\\nbeen reasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or\\nrights of others. The Court noted, in particular, that the articles in question concerned\\n13Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\npublic judicial facts that could be considered to present a degree of general interest. In\\naddition, the actor was sufficiently well known to qualify as a public figure and the fact\\nthat he had been arrested in public and had actively sought the limelight by revealing\\ndetails about his private life in a number of interviews meant that his legitimate\\nexpectation that his private life would be effectively protected was reduced. Moreover,\\nthere was nothing to suggest that the applicant company had not undertaken a\\nbalancing exercise between its interest in publishing and the actor’s right to respect for\\nhis private life. As to the content, form and consequences of the publications, the articles\\nhad not revealed details about the actor’s private life, but had mainly concerned the\\ncircumstances of his arrest and the outcome of the criminal proceedings.\\nTănăsoaica v. Romania\\n19 June 2012\\nThe applicant, who was a journalist, complained about his conviction for insults on\\naccount of the publication of an article about environmental pollution by a company.\\nIn this case the Court reiterated that the press played a key role in a democratic society\\nand that, while it could not cross certain bounds, concerning in particular the protection\\nof the reputation and the rights of others, it was nevertheless entitled to impart, in\\naccordance with its duties and responsibilities, information and ideas on all questions of\\ngeneral interest. There had thus been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, in particular because there had been a debate in the general interest,\\na lack of bad faith in the publication, and a sufficient factual basis.\\nSmolorz v. Poland\\n16 October 2012\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, a journalist, for having damaged the\\ngood reputation of one of the architects named in a highly critical article he had\\npublished on the subject of communist-era architecture in the city of Katowice, Poland.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. Whilst the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression had\\nbeen prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the\\nreputation of others, the Court took the view that the Polish courts had demonstrated\\nrigidity and had given insufficient consideration to the context and nature of the disputed\\narticle. Obliging the applicant to demonstrate the truth of his statements amounted to\\nimposing an unreasonable, if not impossible task. The Court reiterated that a degree of\\nexaggeration, or even provocation, was permitted to the press, which had a duty to\\ncomment on matters of public interest. Lastly, although the penalty imposed on the\\napplicant had been a minor one, the important point was that he had been required to\\napologise publicly for his comments.\\nMladina D.D. Ljubljana v. Slovenia\\n17 April 2014\\nThis case concerned the applicant publisher’s complaint that it was ordered by\\nthe national courts to pay damages to a parliamentarian for insulting him in an article\\nconcerning a parliamentary debate on the legal recognition of same-sex relationships.\\nThe article was published in the publisher’s magazine in June 2005.\\nThe applicant complained, in particular, that the national courts had been unwilling\\nto expose harmful, homophobic stereotypes and had not taken into consideration\\nthat the exaggerated, satirical style of the article was a reaction to the parliamentarian’s\\nown controversial behaviour.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It pointed out that the limits of acceptable criticism were wider as\\nregards a politician, especially when he himself had made controversial public\\nstatements, than as regards a private individual. Both the context in which the\\npublisher’s article had been written (an intense political debate) and the style used\\n(matching the parliamentarian’s own provocative comments and behaviour) had not\\nbeen given sufficient consideration by the national courts. The article had not, therefore,\\n14Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nbeen a gratuitous personal attack on the parliamentarian, but a counter-response to the\\nparliamentarian’s own public remarks and, in particular, conduct which could be\\nregarded as a ridicule of homosexuals and promoting negative stereotypes. Accordingly,\\nthe national courts had failed to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of\\nprotecting the reputation or rights of the parliamentarian and the publisher’s right to\\nfreedom of expression.\\nMustafa Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey\\n27 May 2014\\nSee below, under “Teachers and university lecturers”.\\nAxel Springer AG v. Germany (no.2)\\n18 July 2014\\nThis case concerned the publication of an article in the daily newspaper Bild repeating\\nsuspicions and doubts on the part of the deputy president of the Liberal Democratic\\nParty’s (FDP) parliamentary group with regard to the conditions and circumstances\\npreceding former Chancellor Schröder’s appointment as chairman of the supervisory\\nboard of a German-Russian consortium. The applicant company alleged a violation of its\\nright to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that Bild had not exceeded the limits of journalist freedom in\\npublishing the disputed passage and that the German courts had failed to establish that\\nthere was a pressing social need to put the protection of the reputation of the former\\nFederal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder above the right of the press to freedom of\\nexpression. The Court noted, in particular, that the case concerned matters of public\\ninterest and that the former Chancellor, having held one of the highest political offices in\\nthe Federal Republic of Germany, had a duty to show a much greater degree of tolerance\\nthan a private citizen.\\nStankiewicz and Others v. Poland\\n14 October 2014\\nThe applicants were two journalists and the publisher of the national daily newspaper\\nwhere they both worked. The case concerned an article they published in that paper, in\\nwhich they alleged that a high official of the Ministry of Health was involved in corrupt\\npractices. The applicants complained that the Polish courts’ decisions had violated their\\nright to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding in particular that the Polish judicial authorities had not carried\\nout a careful balancing exercise between the right to impart information and protection\\nof the reputation or rights of others. The reasons relied on by Poland to justify the\\ninterference with the applicants’ right to freedom of expression, although relevant, were\\nnot sufficient to show that that interference was necessary in a democratic society.\\nErla Hlynsdottir v. Iceland (no. 2)\\n21 October 2014\\nThis case concerned the complaint by a journalist of having been found liable for\\ndefamation following the publication in 2007 of an article about a high-profile criminal\\ncase involving the director of a rehabilitation centre and his wife, who were suspected of\\nsexual abuse.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found in particular that the Icelandic courts had not based\\ntheir judgment on relevant and sufficient grounds demonstrating that the applicant had\\nacted in bad faith or without the due diligence. Moreover, they had not balanced\\nher right to freedom of expression as a journalist and the right of the director’s wife to\\nher reputation.\\n15Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nHaldimann and Others v. Switzerland\\n24 February 2015\\nThis case concerned the conviction of four journalists for having recorded and broadcast\\nan interview of a private insurance broker using a hidden camera, as part of a television\\ndocumentary intended to denounce the misleading advice provided by insurance brokers.\\nThe applicants complained that their sentence to payment of fines had amounted to a\\ndisproportionate interference in their right to freedom of expression.\\nIn this case, the Court was for the first time called on to examine an application\\nconcerning the use of hidden cameras by journalists to provide public information on a\\nsubject of general interest, whereby the person filmed was targeted not in any personal\\ncapacity but as a representative of a particular professional category. The Court held\\nthat, in the applicants’ case, there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of\\nexpression) of the Convention, considering in particular that the interference in the\\nprivate life of the broker, who had turned down an opportunity to express his views on\\nthe interview in question, had not been serious enough to override the public interest in\\ninformation on malpractice in the field of insurance brokerage. The Court further also\\nasserted that the applicants deserved the benefit of the doubt in relation to their desire\\nto observe the ethics of journalism as defined by Swiss law, citing the example of their\\nlimited use of the hidden camera.\\nHlynsdottir v. Iceland (no. 3)\\n2 June 2015\\nThis case concerned defamation proceedings against the applicant, a journalist, following\\npublication of an article about an ongoing set of criminal proceedings against a man\\nsuspected of importing a large quantity of cocaine into Iceland. After the first-instance\\ncourt had initially found for the applicant, the Supreme Court overturned the judgment.\\nIt also ordered her and the publisher to pay the claimant compensation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It agreed that the Icelandic Supreme Court’s reasoning was relevant to\\nthe legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of the man suspected of the\\noffence but later acquitted from the charge of importing drugs. However, it found that\\nthe reasons relied on by the Supreme Court had not been sufficient to show that the\\ninterference with the applicant’s rights had been necessary in a democratic society. In\\nparticular, it was clear from the article that the proceedings were pending and had not\\nbeen concluded at the time. Moreover, the impugned statement used the exact wording\\nfrom the indictment, and there was no reason for the applicant to believe that the\\nindictment was not a source on which she could rely.\\nMorar v. Romania\\n7 July 2015\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction and civil liability of a journalist working for a\\nsatirical weekly for defamation against the political adviser to an electoral candidate.\\nThe applicant alleged that his freedom of expression had been impeded.\\nIn this case the Court reiterated, in particular, that while Contracting States were\\npermitted, or even obliged, to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression so as to\\nensure adequate protection by law of individuals’ reputations, they could not do so in a\\nmanner that deterred the media and opinion formers from fulfilling their role of alerting\\nthe public to questions of general interest – such as the relationships between public\\nfigures and the former repressive Romanian regime before 1989. Having regard above\\nall to the importance of the debate on a matter of general interest in the context of\\nwhich the impugned comments had been made and to the amount of damages awarded\\nagainst the applicant, the Court found that the interference with the applicant’s freedom\\nof expression had not been justified by relevant and sufficient reasons. It thus found that\\nthere had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention, as\\nthe interference could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society within the\\nmeaning of Article 10.\\n16Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nDe Carolis and France Télévisions v. France\\n21 January 2016\\nThis case concerned an accusation of defamation brought by Saudi Prince Turki Al Faisal\\non account of a documentary on the France 3 television channel concerning complaints\\nlodged by families of the victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks. The first applicant\\nand the journalist who made the documentary were found guilty of public defamation\\nagainst an individual, Prince Turki Al Faisal, who had joined the proceedings as a “civil\\nparty”. The TV channel France 3 was declared civilly liable for the damage caused.\\nThe applicants complained of a violation of their right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding, after a detailed examination, that the way in which the subject\\nwas dealt with did not contravene the standards of responsible journalism. As regards\\nthe sanctions, the fine to which the first applicant had been sentenced and the civil\\nliability finding against France 3 were a disproportionate interference with their right to\\nfreedom of expression which was not necessary in a democratic society. In this case the\\nCourt observed in particular that the facts reported had concerned a subject of general\\ninterest. It further noted that Prince Turki Al Faisal held an eminent position in the\\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and reiterated that the limits of permissible criticism were\\nwider when it came to civil servants acting in a public capacity in the course of their\\nofficial duties than in the case of ordinary private persons.\\nBédat v. Switzerland\\n29 March 2016 (Grand Chamber)\\nThis case concerned the fining of a journalist for having published documents in breach\\nof the confidentiality of the judicial investigation in criminal proceedings that had been\\nbrought against a driver who had been remanded in custody for crashing into a group of\\npedestrians, killing three and injuring a further eight, before jumping off a bridge.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the penalty imposed on the applicant had been justified.\\nIt considered in particular that the publication of an article slanted in the way it had been\\nat a time when the investigation was still ongoing comprised the inherent risk of\\ninfluencing the conduct of proceedings which had in itself justified the adoption by the\\ndomestic authorities of deterrent measures, such as a ban on disclosing confidential\\ninformation. While accepting that the accused could have had recourse to civil-law\\nremedies to complain of interference in his private life, the Court nevertheless held that\\nthe existence in domestic law of remedies to which the accused could have had recourse\\ndid not dispense the State from its positive obligation to protect the private life of all\\npersons charged in criminal proceedings. Finally, the Court found that the penalty\\nimposed on the journalist for violation of secrecy, geared to protecting the proper\\nfunctioning of justice and the accused’s rights to a fair trial and respect for his private\\nlife, had not amounted to disproportionate interference in the exercise of his right to\\nfreedom of expression\\nNadtoka v. Russia5\\n31 May 2016\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction, for insult, of a journalist and the editor-in-\\nchief (the applicant) of the newspaper in which the offending article – which included the\\nphrase “some thievish man from Altay who had taken up a comfortably high position” to\\nrefer to the mayor of Novocherkassk at the relevant time – had been published.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It found in particular that the offending article had sought to complain\\nof corruption on the part of the mayor of Novocherkassk. A subject of that type was\\na matter of public concern and discussion of it contributed to political debate. With\\nregard to the proceedings, the Court further noted that the domestic courts had not\\nat any stage weighed the right to respect for his reputation of the mayor\\n5. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n17Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nof Novocherkassk, who had been targeted by the article, against the right to freedom of\\nexpression of the applicant, the editor-in-chief. In the Court’s view, that was\\na problematical omission. The Court pointed out that the authorities had enjoyed only\\nparticularly limited room for manoeuvre, and concluded that the interference complained\\nof by the applicant had not been necessary in a democratic society for the protection\\nof the reputation and rights of others.\\nDorota Kania v. Poland\\n19 July 2016\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction on charges of defamation after publishing\\nan article in a national weekly positing that the communist secret police had created the\\nPolish mafia and protected it throughout the 1980s. The article also claimed that State\\nofficials, who became members of the police services under the democratic regime\\npost-1989, had continued to protect their former colleagues still involved in the thriving\\nworld of organised crime.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the applicant’s conviction and sentence were not\\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the reputation\\nor rights of others. The Polish authorities could therefore reasonably find that the\\ninterference with the exercise by the applicant of her right to freedom of expression was\\nnecessary in a democratic society in order to protect the reputation and rights of others.\\nSee also: Dorota Kania v. Poland (no. 2), judgment of 4 October 2016.\\nKapsis and Danikas v. Greece\\n19 January 2017\\nThis case concerned an award of damages of 30,000 euros against the director of a daily\\nnewspaper (the first applicant) and a journalist (the second applicant), jointly with\\nthe newspaper’s proprietor, for a press article describing as “completely unknown”\\nan actress who had been appointed to an advisory board on subsidies awarded by\\nthe authority for theatres.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It found in particular that the Greek authorities had not given\\nrelevant and sufficient grounds to justify the award against the journalists, taking the\\nview that the sanction was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (protection\\nof the reputation or rights of others) and that the judgment did not meet a pressing\\nsocial need. In this respect, the Court noted, inter alia, that the domestic courts had\\nnot placed the offending comments in the general context of the case in order to assess\\nthe intention of the two journalists, who had actually been quite favourable towards the\\nactress’s appointment; she had been appointed to an essentially political position\\nand should have expected her appointment to be subjected to close scrutiny\\nby the press, even to harsh criticism; the applicants had been ordered to pay damages\\nwithout any analysis of their financial situation, and such sanctions would inevitably\\ndiscourage journalists from contributing to a public discussion on questions of interest\\nto the wider community.\\nOlafsson v. Iceland\\n16 March 2017\\nThe applicant was an editor of the web-based media site Pressan. He published articles\\ninsinuating that a political candidate had committed sexual abuse against children.\\nThe Supreme Court of Iceland held the applicant liable for defamation. He complained to\\nthe European Court that this liability had violated his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the Supreme Court of Iceland had failed to strike a\\nreasonable balance between the measures restricting the applicant’s freedom\\nof expression, and the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others.\\nIn particular, the Court considered that the liability for defamation had not been\\nnecessary in a democratic society, given the circumstances of the case. The subject of\\n18Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nthe allegations had been standing for political office and should have anticipated public\\nscrutiny. Furthermore, the articles about him had been published in good faith,\\nin compliance with ordinary journalistic standards, and had contributed to a debate of\\npublic interest. In addition, whilst the allegations had been defamatory, they were being\\nmade not by the applicant himself, but by others. Lastly, the political candidate\\nhad chosen not to sue the persons making the claims, and had thus perhaps prevented\\nthe applicant from establishing that he had acted in good faith and had ascertained the\\ntruth of the allegations.\\nMilisavljević v. Serbia\\n4 April 2017\\nThe case concerned a journalist’s complaint about her conviction for insult following an\\narticle she had written about Nataša Kandić, a well-known human rights activist.\\nThe Serbian courts held that by failing to put one particular sentence – “Ms Kandić [had]\\nbeen called a witch and a prostitute” – in quotation marks, the applicant had tacitly\\nendorsed the words as her own.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the Serbian authorities’ reaction to the applicant’s article\\nhad been disproportionate. The Court considered in particular that it was evident, even\\nwithout the quotation marks, that that sentence, written by another journalist and\\npreviously published in a different magazine, had not been the applicant’s personal\\nopinion of Ms Kandić, but that she had merely been transmitting how Ms Kandić was\\nperceived by others. Moreover, the domestic courts, limiting their reasoning to the lack\\nof quotation marks, had completely failed to balance Ms Kandić’s right to reputation\\nagainst the applicant’s freedom of expression and duty, as a journalist, to impart\\ninformation of general interest.\\nNovaya Gazeta and Milashina v. Russia6\\n3 October 2017\\nThis case concerned defamation proceedings against an editorial house and a journalist\\nfollowing the publication of two articles concerning the sinking of the Russian Navy’s\\nnuclear cruise missile submarine “Kursk” in the Barents Sea in August 2000 and\\nthe investigation into the accident. In particular, the articles in question reported on\\nstatements by a relative of one of the victims and his counsel to the effect that\\nthe officials in charge of the investigation, which had eventually been terminated,\\nwere guilty of abuse of public office.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It considered in particular that the publisher and the journalist had been\\nfound liable for having reported the opinions of third parties. Although particularly strong\\nreasons would have been required to punish a journalist for assisting in\\nthe dissemination of statements made by another person, the national courts had\\nnot provided any such reasons. They had considered it completely irrelevant whether\\nthe journalist had expressed her own views or those of a third party. Overall,\\nthe national courts’ reasoning in the case had appeared to be based on the assumption\\nthat the protection of the claimants’ reputation prevailed over freedom of expression\\nin all circumstances.\\nEker v. Turkey\\n24 October 2017\\nThis case concerned the requirement for the applicant, a newspaper publisher, to print a\\nreply correcting an article which he had written and published in his newspaper, in which\\nhe criticised the local journalists’ association, alleging that its actions contradicted its\\nmain objective and that it was no longer fit for its intended purpose. The reply was\\nwritten by the local journalists’ association in response to these criticisms. The applicant\\ncomplained in particular of being compelled to print the text correcting his article;\\n6. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n19Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nin his view, this had harmed his reputation and dignity and amounted to interference\\nwith his freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It found, in particular, that the domestic courts had struck a fair\\nbalance between the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and the right of the local\\njournalists’ association to protection of its reputation. The Court considered that the\\nreply had not overstepped the limits of admissible criticism and that the order to publish\\nhad been proportionate to the aim pursued, namely to protect the reputation and rights\\nof others. Furthermore, the applicant had not been required to amend the content of his\\narticle and there had been nothing to prevent him from re-publishing his version\\nof the facts.\\nFrisk and Jensen v. Denmark\\n5 December 2017\\nThis case concerned two Danish journalists working for a national television station and\\ntheir conviction of defamation following a programme broadcast criticising the treatment\\nof cancer at Copenhagen University Hospital. The Danish courts concluded that their\\nprogramme had undisputedly given viewers the impression that malpractice had\\noccurred at the hospital. They found in particular that the programme had accused the\\nhospital’s cancer consultant of preferring to use a chemotherapy which was just a test\\nproduct in order to promote his professional prestige and personal finances; and that\\nthat had resulted in certain patients dying or having their lives cut short.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the applicants’ defamation conviction had been justified.\\nThe Court agreed in particular with the Danish courts’ decisions, considering that they\\nhad struck a fair balance between the journalists’ right to freedom of expression and the\\nhospital’s and the consultant’s right to protection of their reputation. In particular\\nthe Court saw no reason to call into question the domestic courts’ conclusion that the\\nprogramme had been factually incorrect. It also agreed that those wrongful accusations,\\ndisseminated on primetime national television, had had considerable negative\\nconsequences, namely public mistrust in the chemotherapy used at the hospital.\\nSallusti v. Italy\\n7 March 2019\\nFound guilty of defamation, the applicant, a journalist, was fined and given a prison\\nsentence, part of which he served under house arrest. The national courts found that\\narticles published under his control had falsely reported that a 13-year old girl had been\\nforced to have an abortion by her parents and a guardianship judge, despite\\nclarifications in the press the day before that the girl had wanted the abortion.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the sentence following the applicant’s conviction for\\ndefamation had been manifestly disproportionate. It accepted that the interference with\\nhis right to freedom of expression had been intended to protect the reputation and rights\\nof the 13-year old girl and her parents as well as those of the guardianship judge, and\\nalso agreed with the national courts’ findings that the articles under the applicant’s\\ncontrol had given false information, despite the clarifications reported the day before.\\nHe had thus seriously tarnished the honour and privacy rights of all those involved.\\nThe Court found however that there had been no justification for imposing a prison\\nsentence and such a sanction had gone beyond what would have amounted to a\\n“necessary” restriction on the applicant’s freedom of expression.\\nFreitas Rangel v. Portugal\\n11 January 2022\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, a very well-known journalist, for\\nstatements made about the professional bodies for judges and for public prosecutors at a\\nhearing of a parliamentary committee. In particular, he had linked the judiciary and the\\nprosecution service to, among other things, interference in politics and widespread\\n20Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nbreaches of confidentiality. He had been convicted and had had to pay 56,000 euros in\\nfines and damages in total.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the domestic courts had failed to give adequate reasoning\\nfor their interference with the applicant’s free-speech rights, and that the interference\\nhad not been necessary in a democratic society. The Court reiterated, in particular, that\\nthe protection of the reputation of a legal entity did not have the same strength as the\\nprotection of the reputation or rights of individuals. In the present case, it observed that\\nthe reasoning of the appellate court had been based solely on the rights of the\\nprofessional associations, rather than balancing their rights with those of the applicant.\\nThe Court also found that the fine and the damages had been wholly disproportionate\\nand had to have had a chilling effect on political discussion.\\nOOO Memo v. Russia7\\n15 March 2022\\nThis case concerned a civil defamation suit brought by the Volgograd Region Authority\\nagainst an online media outlet, which was owned by the applicant company, following\\nthe publication of an article in the context of the suspension of the transfer of 5,294,000\\nRussian roubles in subsidies from Volgograd Region to Volgograd City. The applicant\\ncompany complained of an interference with its right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the defamation proceedings and the consequent\\ninterference had not had a “legitimate aim” under the Convention. It noted in particular\\nthat, although protection of reputation was a right under Article 8 (right to respect\\nfor private and family life) of the Convention, an attack on reputation had\\nto be serious enough to warrant protection under that provision. Moreover, regarding\\npublic bodies, the Court highlighted that it had found that only in exceptional\\ncircumstances could a measure proscribing statements criticising the acts or omissions of\\nan elected body be justified. It added that State executive bodies were essentially\\ndifferent from State-owned companies or other legal entities, as the latter had\\nto compete in the marketplace. Reputation was consequently important for them\\nto attract and retain customers. Executive authorities, on the other hand, were funded\\nby taxpayers. The Court also reiterated that allowing State executive bodies to bring\\ndefamation proceedings against the media placed a disproportionate burden on\\nthe media. In the present case, the Court considered that there could not have been\\nan interest in protecting the Volgograd Region Authority’s commercial success which\\nwould have potentially justified the legal action; nor had the employees of\\nthe organisation been harmed by the allegations.\\nHurbain v. Belgium\\n4 July 2023 (Grand Chamber)\\nThe case concerned the civil judgment against Mr Hurbain, as publisher of the daily\\nnewspaper Le Soir, ordering him to anonymise, on grounds of the “right to be forgotten”,\\nan article in the digital archives mentioning the full name of the driver responsible for a\\nfatal road-traffic accident in 1994.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that, regard being had to the States’ margin of appreciation,\\nthe Belgian courts had carefully balanced the rights at stake in accordance with the\\nrequirements of the Convention, such that the interference with the right guaranteed by\\nArticle 10 on account of the anonymisation of the electronic version of the article on the\\nwebsite of the newspaper Le Soir had been limited to what was strictly necessary.\\nIt could thus, in the circumstances of the case, be regarded as necessary in a democratic\\nsociety and proportionate. The Court noted, in particular, that the national courts had\\ntaken account in a coherent manner of the nature and seriousness of the judicial facts\\nreported on in the article in question, the fact that the article had no topical, historical or\\n7. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n21Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nscientific interest, and the fact that the driver was not well known. In addition, they had\\nattached importance to the serious harm suffered by the driver as a result of the\\ncontinued online availability of the article with unrestricted access, which had been apt\\nto create a “virtual criminal record”, especially in view of the length of time elapsing\\nsince the original publication of the article. Furthermore, after reviewing the measures\\nthat might be considered in order to balance the rights at stake – a review whose scope\\nhad been consistent with the procedural standards applicable in Belgium – they had held\\nthat the anonymisation of the article had not imposed an excessive and impracticable\\nburden on the applicant, while constituting the most effective means of protecting the\\ndriver’s privacy.\\nRadio Broadcasting Company B92 AD v. Serbia\\n5 September 2023\\nThis case concerned civil proceedings brought against the applicant broadcasting\\ncompany by a former assistant health minister for its reporting in 2011 that she had\\nbeen suspected of abuse of office, amid an ongoing controversy over the procurement of\\nswine flu vaccines. the applicant company alleged that ordering it to pay compensation\\nand costs had been in breach of its right to impart information. It argued in particular\\nthat its intention had not been to attack the honour and reputation of the assistant\\nhealth minister at the time of facts, but to provide faithfully information from an official\\npolice document which contributed to a debate of interest – namely irregularities in the\\npublic procurement of swine-flu vaccines and pressure on investigative bodies.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention in the present case, finding that, overall, the applicant company had\\nacted in good faith and with the diligence expected of responsible journalism. The Court\\nnoted in particular that the Serbian courts had acknowledged that the information\\npublished by the applicant company had contributed to a public debate and that\\nsomeone in the assistant health minister’s position should have shown a greater degree\\nof tolerance. The courts had gone too far, however, in their criticism of the applicant\\ncompany’s fact-checking. The company had based its reporting on a note obtained from\\npolice officers about the investigation into the controversy, and there had been\\nno doubts over the note’s credibility. The language used in the reporting had been\\naccurate and not exaggerated, and all the parties had been contacted to obtain\\ntheir version of events.\\nEigirdas and VĮ Demokratijos plėtros fondas v. Lithuania\\n12 September 2023\\nThis case concerned two articles published in the magazine Valstybė, one of which\\nconcerned, amongst other individuals, a prominent businessman and politician, and the\\nother, in particular, his son. The articles alleged media influence and a connection to\\nforthcoming elections on the part of the businessman in question. Following complaints\\nand subsequent court proceedings, decisions against the applicants – the writer of the\\nfirst article and the publisher – were delivered by the Public Information Ethics\\nCommission. The applicants complained about the requirement to publish the Ethics\\nCommission’s decisions in Valstybė.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention with regard to the two articles in question. It found in particular that the\\nrestrictions on freedom of speech imposed as regards the first article had required very\\nstrong reasons, which the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania had failed\\nto provide. As regards the second article, the Court held that the Lithuanian law referred\\nto by the courts had not accorded with the Council of Europe recommendations on right\\nof reply, and that the sanction imposed was capable of having a chilling effect on the\\nexercise of freedom of expression.\\n22Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nSee also, among others:\\nKieser and Tralau-Kleinert v.

He complained about the civil\\njudgment against him ordering him to pay compensation for infringing the personality\\nrights of the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of Appeal after expressing his opinion\\non the criminal proceedings in question during a live broadcast on the main Greek\\ntelevision news programme.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention finding that, while it was not disputed that the interference by the Greek\\nauthorities with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by\\nlaw and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others, the civil\\njudgment ordering him to pay damages to the public prosecutor had not met a pressing\\nsocial need. In this respect, it noted in particular that the domestic courts had ignored\\nthe extensive media coverage of the case, in the context of which the applicant’s\\nappearance on the television news was more indicative of an intention to defend his\\nclient’s arguments in public than of a desire to impugn the public prosecutor’s character.\\nMoreover, they had not taken account of the fact that the comments had been broadcast\\nlive and could therefore not have been rephrased.\\nReznik v. Russia10\\n4 April 2013\\nThis case concerned defamation proceedings against the president of the Moscow City\\nBar for critical statements on a live TV show about the conduct of male prison warders\\nwho had searched the female lawyer representing a prominent businessman.\\nThe applicant complained that his right to freedom of expression had been\\ndisproportionately restricted.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the applicant had not gone beyond the limits of acceptable\\ncriticism, that his statement had rested on a sufficient factual basis, and that the Moscow\\nCity Court, which had found him liable for defamation, had not based its decision on an\\nacceptable assessment of the relevant facts. In particular, the City Court had failed to\\nperform any balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiffs’ reputation and\\nthe public interest. Furthermore, although the applicant had had to pay only a negligible\\namount of money in compensation, the institution of defamation proceedings against\\nhim had been capable of having a deterrent effect on his freedom of expression.\\nFuchs v. Germany\\n27 January 2015 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the complaint by a lawyer of criminal and disciplinary sanctions\\nimposed on him for, among other things, defamatory statements against an expert for\\nthe prosecution, which the lawyer had made while representing a client.\\nThe Court declared the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. It noted in particular that\\nthe sanctions imposed on the applicant had interfered with his freedom of expression. At\\nthe same time, it observed that the sanctions had been prescribed by law – being based\\non the German Criminal Code and the Code for the legal profession, respectively; and\\nthey had pursued the legitimate aim of, in particular, protecting the reputation and\\nrights of the sworn-in expert. Moreover, the Court came to the conclusion that the\\nsanctions had been necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of Article 10 of\\nthe Convention.\\nMorice v. France\\n23 April 2015 (Grand Chamber)\\nThis case concerned the conviction of a lawyer, on account of remarks reported in the\\npress, for complicity in defamation of the investigating judges who had been removed\\nfrom the judicial investigation into the death of Judge Bernard Borrel. The applicant\\n10.

The Court however\\nheld that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the judgment against the applicant for complicity in\\ndefamation could be regarded as a disproportionate interference with his right\\nto freedom of expression, and was not therefore necessary in a democratic\\nsociety”within the meaning of Article 10.\\nPeruzzi v. Italy\\n30 June 2015\\nThis case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant, a lawyer, for having\\ndefamed an investigating judge (Judge X) in the context of proceedings regarding the\\ndivision of an estate in which he had been acting for two clients. The applicant sent\\na circular letter to Judge X and other judges of the Lucca District Court containing the\\ntext of a previous letter he had written to the Supreme Council of the Judiciary\\ncomplaining of Judge X’s conduct.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It found in particular that one of the two criticisms levelled against\\nJudge X by the applicant had implied that the former had disregarded his ethical\\nobligations as a judge or had even committed a criminal offence. However, the applicant\\nhad not sought to establish the truth of his allegations of wrongful conduct. The Court\\nconsidered that his conviction could reasonably be considered necessary in a democratic\\nsociety in order to protect the reputation of others and maintain the authority\\nand impartiality of the judiciary.\\nBono v. France\\n15 December 2015\\nThis case concerned a disciplinary sanction imposed on the applicant, as lawyer acting\\nfor a suspected terrorist, for remarks made in his pleadings before the Court of Appeal.\\nHe claimed that the French investigating judges had been complicit in the torture of\\nhis client by the Syrian secret services and thus sought the exclusion of statements\\nobtained through the use of torture. The applicant complained about the disciplinary\\nsanction imposed on him.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found in particular that the remarks in question, as they were so\\nharsh, clearly showed some contempt for the investigating judges. However, they did\\nnot refer to the judges personally but concerned the manner in which they had carried\\nout the investigation. The written submissions, which had a factual basis, contributed\\ndirectly to the defence of the applicant’s client and did not leave the courtroom. As the\\napplicant had already been summoned to show moderation, during the hearing in the\\nParis Court of Appeal, the Court found that the disciplinary sanction was not\\nproportionate. In this case the Court also recalled that, while it was for judicial and\\ndisciplinary authorities, in the interest of the proper functioning of the justice system, to\\npenalise certain conduct by lawyers, those authorities had to ensure that such scrutiny\\ndid not have a chilling effect that would hinder them in defending their clients’ interests.\\nRodriguez Ravelo v. Spain\\n12 January 2016\\nThis case concerned expressions used by a lawyer in a written application containing\\nvalue judgments regarding a judge and attributing blameworthy conduct to her. The\\napplicant complained about his conviction and sentence on the grounds that these were\\na disproportionate interference in the exercise of his right to express himself freely in the\\ncontext of his professional duties.\\n25Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. Admittedly, the applicant’s conviction and sentence had been prescribed\\nby law and the interference in the exercise of his right to freedom of expression had\\npursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and rights of the district judge\\nand maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. However, the Court found\\nthat the applicant’s criminal conviction was capable of having a chilling effect on lawyers\\ncalled upon to defend their clients. The Spanish criminal courts had therefore failed to\\nstrike a fair balance between the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary and the\\nneed to protect freedom of expression. The sentence imposed on the lawyer had\\ntherefore not been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and accordingly had not\\nbeen necessary in a democratic society.\\nOttan v. France\\n19 April 2018\\nThis case originated in the acquittal in 2009 of a gendarme who had killed a young man\\nfrom a community of foreign origin, living in a working class neighbourhood, during a car\\nchase in 2003. A few minutes after the verdict, in response to a question from a\\njournalist, the applicant, a lawyer who had been representing the victim’s father, stated\\nthat the acquittal was not a surprise, given the ethnic composition of the jury, which was\\nexclusively composed of “whites”. A Court of Appeal imposed a disciplinary penalty,\\nnamely a warning, finding that the lawyer had failed to comply with his professional\\nethical obligations of sensitivity and moderation. He complained that the penalty had\\namounted to an unjustified infringement of his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It noted in particular that the penalty had amounted to an interference\\nwith the applicant’s exercise of the right to freedom of expression, which had been\\nprescribed by law and pursued the aims of protecting the reputation or rights of others\\nand maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. It also found that the\\ncontested remarks had been made as part of a debate on the functioning of the criminal\\njustice system, in the context of media coverage of a case. Taken in their context, they\\ndid not amount to an insulting or racially motivated accusation, but concerned\\nthe impartiality and representative nature of the assize court jury; in other words,\\nthe lawyer had made a general statement about the organisation of the criminal courts.\\nCapable of causing offence, these remarks were nonetheless a value judgment with a\\nsufficient factual basis, and formed part of the defence of the lawyer’s client. Lastly, the\\nCourt considered that the sentence, consisting in the lightest possible penalty, had\\nnonetheless been disproportionate and had not been necessary in a democratic society.\\nPais Pires de Lima v. Portugal\\n12 February 2019\\nThe applicant, a lawyer, alleged a breach of freedom of expression following a civil\\njudgment ordering him to pay damages to a judge whose personal and professional\\nhonour and reputation he had attacked.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression\\nhad not been necessary in a democratic society. It noted in particular that although\\nthe grounds given by the national courts for imposing civil liability appeared relevant and\\nsufficient, given that the applicant had been unable to substantiate his factual\\nstatements by supporting evidence, the amount of compensation awarded had been\\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the protection of the rights\\nof others.\\nL.P. and Carvalho v. Portugal\\n8 October 2019 (Committee judgment)\\nThe case concerned findings of liability against two lawyers for defamation (the first\\napplicant) and for attacking a person’s honour (the second applicant) in respect of two\\njudges, on account of documents drawn up by the lawyers in their capacity as\\n26Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nrepresentatives. The applicants complained of an infringement of their freedom of\\nexpression as lawyers.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention in respect of the two applicants. It found, in particular, that both\\napplicants had been acting in the performance of their professional duties as lawyers.\\nIt further considered that the penalties had been apt to have a chilling effect on the\\nprofession of lawyer as a whole, especially with regard to lawyers’ defence of their\\nclients’ interests. Consequently, the reasons given by the domestic courts to justify\\nfinding the applicants liable had been neither relevant nor sufficient and had not\\ncorresponded to a pressing social need. The interference had thus been disproportionate\\nand had not been necessary in a democratic society.\\nNotaries\\nAna Ioniță v. Romania\\n21 March 2017\\nThe applicant is a public notary and her professional authority had imposed various\\ndisciplinary sanctions on her for, inter alia, having criticised, on television, the National\\nUnion of Romanian Public Notaries and the Chamber of Notaries of Bacău, of which\\nshe was a member. She complained that there had been a breach of her freedom\\nof expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention. It found that the Romanian courts had balanced the conflicting\\ninterests, in the light of domestic law, and had concluded that the applicant had\\ntransgressed the permissible limits of the right to criticise, and that the domestic\\nauthorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation by sanctioning her.\\nOpposition activists\\nSavenko (Limonov) v. Russia11\\n26 November 2019 (Committee judgment)\\nThis case concerned defamation proceedings against the applicant instituted by a former\\nmayor of Moscow, following his participation in a live radio debate on Radio Free\\nEurope/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which focussed on a court decision upholding a refusal\\nby the Moscow authorities to authorise a rally, known as the Dissenters’ March.\\nThe applicant, one of the leaders of a broad coalition of opposition groups involved in\\norganising such rallies, had expressed the view that the Moscow courts were controlled\\nby the mayor of Moscow.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding in particular that the Russian courts had found against the\\napplicant without taking account of the fact that his comments had been made in the\\ncourse of a debate on matters of public interest and that politicians had to accept a high\\nlevel of criticism. In fact, the domestic courts had ruled that the mayor deserved more\\nprotection than ordinary citizens. The Court also found that the amount of the\\ndefamation award, 500,000 Russian roubles (about 14,000 euros), had been excessive.\\nPolitical figures\\nKeller v. Hungary\\n4 April 2006 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, a Member of Parliament, for\\naccusing a minister of neglecting his duties out of loyalty towards his father. At a\\nparliamentary session, while questioning the Prime Minister, the applicant had alleged\\nthat failure to investigate a matter of national security, namely the practices of extreme\\n11. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n27Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nright-wing groups, might have been due to the fact that the responsible Minister’s father\\nwas a member of an extreme right-wing movement related to Nazis.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, finding\\nthat the interference with the applicant’s exercise of his right to freedom of expression\\ncould reasonably be regarded by the Hungarian authorities as necessary in a democratic\\nsociety for the protection of the reputation and rights of others. It recalled in particular\\nthat the protection of the reputation of others provided for by Article 10 § 2 of the\\nConvention extended to politicians too, a fortiori to a situation where a politician was\\ncriticised by another one, especially if that criticism was voiced in the privileged arena of\\nParliament. However, the applicant had not limited himself to attacking his opponent in\\nParliament. The identity of the applicant’s target had only become clear afterwards, with\\nhis further explanation in a television broadcast. Such public insinuations no longer\\nbenefited from the privilege afforded to parliamentary debate. Moreover, the applicant\\nhad been sued before the civil courts (rather than the criminal courts) and had been\\nordered to arrange for a rectification in the press and to pay damages in an amount\\nwhich was less than twice the gross monthly salary to which he had been entitled at the\\ntime. The Court did not find those sanctions excessive in the circumstances of the case.\\nTête v. France\\n26 March 2020\\nThe applicant, a lawyer and a municipal councillor in Lyons, complained about his\\nconviction for malicious falsehood on account of an open letter which he had written to\\nthe President of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), in which he accused the\\nOlympique Lyonnais Group (“the OL Group”) and its CEO of providing false and\\nmisleading information during the company’s stock-market flotation. The flotation had\\nbeen aimed at allowing the construction of a new football stadium known as “OL Land” in\\na suburb of Lyons.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of\\nexpression had not been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (namely the\\nprotection of the reputation or rights of others, in this instance those of the CEO of the\\nOL Group) and that the reasons given for the French courts’ decisions had been\\ninsufficient to justify it. The Court noted in particular that the domestic courts had not\\nduly examined the necessity of the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of\\nexpression. It also observed that the AMF had not taken any action in response to the\\nletter and that no proceedings had been instituted against the CEO of the OL Group.\\nMoreover, the applicant had been writing on an issue of general concern and in a context\\nof political and campaigning activity. The Court lastly noted the fact that the sanctions\\nimposed had been of a criminal nature.\\nMesić v. Croatia\\n5 May 2022\\nThis case concerned civil proceedings for defamation in which the applicant – a former\\nPresident of Croatia – had been ordered by the Croatian courts to pay the equivalent of\\n6,660 euros to a specialist lawyer of Croatian origin practising in France, for having\\ntarnished his reputation.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of\\nexpression had been necessary in a democratic society. It considered, in particular,\\nthat the statement made by the applicant had not only been detrimental to the lawyer’s\\nreputation but had also been capable of having a “chilling”, dissuasive effect on the\\nexercise of his professional duties. Therefore, the awarding of damages had been an\\nappropriate sanction to neutralise that effect and proportionate to the aim of protecting\\nthe lawyer’s reputation. The Court held, however, that there had been a violation of\\nArticle 6 § 1 (right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time) of the Convention in the\\npresent case, finding that the length of the civil proceedings had been excessive.\\n28Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nPatrício Monteiro Telo de Abreu v. Portugal\\n7 June 2022\\nThis case concerned the conviction of the applicant, a local politician, and his sentencing\\nto payment of a fine and damages for aggravated defamation of a municipal councillor\\non account of the publication on a blog administered by him of three cartoons drawn by\\nan artist. The applicant alleged a breach of his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that, notwithstanding the margin of appreciation left to the\\nnational authorities in the present case, the applicant’s conviction had not struck a fair\\nbalance between the protection of his right to freedom of expression and right of the\\nmunicipal councillor in question to the protection of her reputation. It noted in particular\\nthat the Portuguese courts had not taken sufficient account of the context in which the\\napplicant had published the cartoons on his blog and that they had not carried out a\\nthorough balancing exercise between the rights at stake. Furthermore, they had not\\ntaken into consideration the characteristics of political satire emerging from the Court’s\\ncase-law or made any reference to the Court’s case-law on freedom of expression. In the\\npresent case, the Court considered that the reasons given by the domestic courts to\\njustify the applicant’s conviction could not be regarded as relevant and sufficient.\\nIn its view, imposing criminal sanctions for conduct such as that of the applicant in the\\npresent case was liable to have a chilling effect on satirical forms of expression\\nconcerning political issues. The applicant’s conviction had thus not been necessary in a\\ndemocratic society.\\nPonta v. Romania\\n14 June 2022\\nThis case concerned an award of damages against the applicant, a former politician and\\nPrime Minister, for posting comments directed at another person on his Facebook page,\\nwhich the domestic courts found to be defamatory. The applicant complained that the\\naward against him had amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of\\nexpression which had not been necessary in a democratic society.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicant’s exercise of his right to\\nfreedom of expression had not been “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court\\nobserved in particular that the domestic courts had not applied the criteria laid down in\\nits case-law to balance the right of the claimant (a former junior minister) to respect for\\nhis reputation against the right of the applicant (a former Prime Minister) to freedom of\\nexpression. It held that the domestic courts had not convincingly established that there\\nwas a pressing social need to put the protection of the personality rights of the claimant,\\na public figure, above the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and above\\nthe general interest in promoting that freedom where matters of public interest\\nwere concerned.\\nSee also, among others:\\nde Lesquen du Plessis-Casso v.

In this regard it was important not to confuse the intentions of the applicant with\\nthose of the sensationalist press, which had taken an interest in the case in particular\\nbecause the doctor was well known. Yet this seemed to be what had happened before\\nthe Greek courts, which had failed to place the applicant’s remarks in the particular\\ncontext of the case, or to take proper account of the distress felt by the applicant when\\nshe had made the statements.\\nTešić v. Serbia\\n11 February 2014\\nIn 2006 the applicant, a pensioner suffering from various illnesses, was found guilty of\\ndefaming her lawyer. In July 2009 the Municipal Court issued an enforcement order\\nrequiring two thirds of the applicant’s pension to be transferred to the lawyer’s bank\\naccount each month, until the sums awarded had been paid in full. The applicant\\ncomplained of the defamation judgment in the civil proceedings, and of the way the\\ncompensation payment had been enforced. She stated in particular that the enforcement\\nhad caused her extreme financial hardship.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that, while the impugned measures had been prescribed by law\\nand had been adopted in pursuit of a legitimate aim, namely for the protection of the\\nreputation of another, this interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of\\nexpression had not been necessary in a democratic society. The Court noted in particular\\nthat it could not be said that the applicant’s statement in respect of her former counsel\\nwas merely a gratuitous personal attack. After all, the police had clearly seen some merit\\nin the allegations. Moreover, the Serbian Government’s assertion that a discussion of a\\npractising lawyer’s professional conduct was clearly of no public interest was in itself\\ndubious, particularly bearing in mind the role of lawyers in the proper administration\\nof justice.\\nVedat Şorli v. Turkey\\n19 October 2021\\nThis case concerned the sentencing of the applicant to a term of imprisonment – with\\ndelivery of the judgement suspended for five years – for insulting the President of the\\nRepublic, on account of two posts which he shared on his Facebook account. The content\\ncomprised, among other things, a caricature and a photograph of the President of the\\nRepublic accompanied by satirical and critical comments concerning him. The judgment\\nconvicting the applicant was based on Article 299 of the Criminal Code, which afforded a\\nhigher level of protection to the President of the Republic than to other persons.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that, in view of the sanction, of a criminal character, imposed on\\nthe applicant under a special provision affording increased protection to the President of\\nthe Republic against insult – which could not be considered in keeping with the spirit of\\nthe Convention – the Turkish Government had not demonstrated that the measure\\ncomplained of was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued or was necessary in a\\ndemocratic society. Under Article 46 (binding force and execution of judgments) of the\\nConvention, the Court also stressed, in particular, that affording increased protection by\\nmeans of a special law on insult would not, as a rule, be in keeping with the spirit of the\\n30Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nConvention, and that a State’s interest in protecting the reputation of its head of State\\ncould not serve as justification for affording the head of State privileged status or special\\nprotection vis-à-vis the right to convey information and opinions concerning him.\\nSee also, among others:\\nMatalas v.

The authorities had accused the applicant on the basis of\\nstatements he had made about the then Prime Minister (Mr Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) in a\\nspeech given in front of the Ankara Law Courts in December 2012, during a rally in\\nsupport of students who had been placed in police custody four days before in the ODTÜ\\nuniversity campus for having protested against a visit by the Prime Minister.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression)\\nof the Convention, finding that the national authorities had not conducted an adequate\\nbalancing exercise, compatible with the principles set out in the Court’s case-law,\\nbetween the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and the opposing party’s\\nright to respect for his private life. In any event, there had been no reasonable\\nrelationship of proportionality between the interference with the applicant’s right to\\nfreedom of expression and the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of\\nthe individual concerned.\\n31Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nTeachers and university lecturers\\nBoldea v. Romania\\n15 February 2007\\nThe applicant was a university lecturer. At a meeting of the teaching staff in his\\ndepartment during which it emerged that there was general dissatisfaction with regard\\nto the publications produced within the department, the Dean of the faculty raised the\\nsubject of alleged plagiarism in scientific publications. The applicant was the only\\nparticipant who considered unreservedly that the publications of two authors amounted\\nto plagiarism. The authors of the theses brought proceedings for defamation and the\\napplicant was sentenced to pay an administrative fine. He maintained in particular that\\nhis penalty for defamation had infringed his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the national authorities had not given relevant and sufficient\\nreasons to justify ordering the applicant to pay an administrative fine and pay the\\ncomplainants’ costs, and that the fine imposed on him had therefore not met a pressing\\nsocial need. The Court noted in particular that the applicant’s allegations had been\\nserious in that he had accused two colleagues of plagiarism, but had had a factual basis.\\nMoreover, the statements in question had not concerned aspects of his colleagues’\\nprivate life but conduct relating to their capacity as academics.\\nSorguç v. Turkey\\n23 June 2009\\nThis case concerned the award of damages against the applicant, a university professor,\\nfor allegedly denigrating a colleague in one of his academic papers in which he criticised\\nprocedures for recruiting and promoting assistant lecturers. The latter had brought civil\\nproceedings for compensation against the applicant claiming that certain comments used\\nin that paper represented an attack on his reputation. The applicant complained of the\\ndomestic courts’ decisions which found him guilty of defamation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the Turkish authorities had failed to strike a fair balance\\nbetween the relevant interests. In particular, without addressing the applicant’s\\narguments, the domestic courts had concluded that the impugned statements had\\nconstituted an attack on the plaintiff’s reputation. Further, they had not explained why\\nthe reputation of the plaintiff, whose name had not even been mentioned in the paper,\\nhad outweighed the applicant’s freedom of expression. In this judgment the Court also\\nunderlined the importance of academic freedom, and in particular the freedom of\\nacademics to express freely their opinion about the institution or system in which they\\nworked and their freedom to disseminate knowledge and truth without restriction.\\nMustafa Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey\\n27 May 2014\\nThis case concerned the complaint by a law professor, editor and publisher that they\\nwere ordered by the Turkish courts to pay damages to three judges of the Constitutional\\nCourt for insulting them in a journal article which reported on a decision dissolving a\\npolitical party. The article was published in a quarterly law journal in 2001.\\nThe applicants complained that the national courts’ decisions against them were in\\nviolation of their right to the freedom of expression, in particular because their criticisms\\nof the judges had a basis in fact, were in conformity with the law, and fell within the\\nbounds of acceptable criticism of judges in a democratic society.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It stated in particular that members of the judiciary acting in an official\\ncapacity should expect to be subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary\\ncitizens. Both the context (a virulent public debate on the Constitutional Court’s rulings)\\nin which the article had been written and the form (a quasi-academic journal, not a\\npopular newspaper) used had not been given sufficient consideration by the national\\n32Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\ncourts in the defamation proceedings against the applicants. The Court underlined the\\nimportance of academic freedom and, in particular, academics’ ability to freely express\\ntheir views, even if controversial or unpopular, in the areas of their research,\\nprofessional expertise and competence. As to the content of the article, whilst some of\\nthe remarks made were harsh they were largely value judgments, set out in general\\nterms, with sufficient factual basis. They could not be considered gratuitous personal\\nattacks on the three judges. Accordingly, the Court determined that the reasons given,\\nnamely the judges’ right to be protected against personal insult, to justify interfering in\\nthe applicants’ right to voice criticism on a topic of general interest were not sufficient to\\nshow that that interference had been necessary in a democratic society.\\nKharlamov v. Russia12\\n8 October 2015\\nThis case concerned a civil action in defamation brought against the applicant, a\\nuniversity professor, by his employer, Orel State Technical University, after he expressed\\nthe view that the University’s governing body could not be considered legitimate due to\\nshortcomings in the election procedure. The applicant complained that the defamation\\nproceedings brought against him had breached his right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention. It found in particular that the Russian courts, in their decisions against\\nthe applicant, had notably failed to take into account the specific features of academic\\nrelations. In particular, the protection of a university’s authority or reputation under the\\nConvention could not be equated to that of an individual’s. Focusing their attention\\nentirely on the applicant’s description of the elected senate as illegitimate, the Russian\\ncourts had therefore failed to strike a fair balance between the need to protect the\\nUniversity’s reputation and the applicant’s freedom to express his opinion on the\\norganisation of academic life.\\nSee also, among others:\\nAurelian Oprea v.

The Court saw in particular no reason to call into question\\nthe Spanish courts’ findings that the content of the newsletter had been offensive and\\ncapable of harming the reputation of others. It stressed that a clear distinction had to be\\nmade between criticism and insult and that the latter might, in principle, justify\\nsanctions.

France\\n6 October 2011\\nThis case concerned the conviction for public defamation of trade-union leaders for\\nstrident criticism of their mayor employer.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention, finding that the interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of\\nexpression, in their capacity as trade union officials, had not been necessary in a\\ndemocratic society. Observing in particular that, in their capacity as representatives of a\\ntrade union, the applicants had nevertheless been obliged to ensure that their remarks\\nfell within the limits of the right to freedom of expression, namely by giving\\nconsideration to the interest of the protection of the reputation and rights of others, the\\nCourt noted that the mayor, who had been identifiable from the leaflet at issue, had not\\nhowever been mentioned by name. He had simply been criticised in connection with his\\nduties, and no allegations of a private nature had been made against him. The Court\\nreiterated in this regard that the limits of acceptable criticism were wider as regards a\\npolitician than as regards a private individual. Politicians inevitably and knowingly laid\\nthemselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed by both journalists and\\nthe public at large, and they consequently had to display a greater degree of tolerance\\ntowards criticism.\\nRight to protection of reputation as an aspect of the right to\\nrespect for private life\\nHistorical figures\\nDzhugashvili v. Russia13\\n9 December 2014 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned articles published by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper about the\\nshooting of Polish prisoners of war in Katyń in 1940 and the role which the former Soviet\\nleaders had allegedly played in the tragedy. The applicant, the grandson of the former\\nSoviet leader, Joseph Stalin, sued the newspaper for defamation of his grandfather,\\nwithout success. Before the Court, he complained in particular that the District Court of\\nMoscow had failed to protect his well-known ancestor from attacks on his reputation.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, finding\\nthat the national courts had struck a fair balance between the applicant’s privacy rights\\nand journalistic freedom of expression. Reaffirming the principle that publications\\nconcerning the reputation of a deceased member of a person’s family might, in certain\\ncircumstances, affect that person’s private life and identity and thus come within the\\nscope of Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of the Convention, the Court however\\ndistinguished between defamation of a private individual, whose reputation as part and\\nparcel of their families’ reputation remains within the scope of Article 8, and legitimate\\ncriticism of public figures who expose themselves to outside scrutiny. In the present\\ncase, it found, in particular, that the Novaya Gazeta articles concerned an event of\\nsignificant historical importance and that both the event and historical figures involved,\\nsuch as the applicant’s grandfather, inevitably remain open to public scrutiny and\\ncriticism. It also found that the Russian courts, taking into account the European Court’s\\ncase law, had carefully balanced the competing interests of journalistic expression and\\nthe applicant’s right to respect for his private life and that of his grandfather.\\n13. On 16 September 2022 the Russian Federation ceased to be a Party to the Convention.\\n34Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nPersons arrested or under criminal prosecution\\nWhite v. Sweden\\n19 September 2006\\nThe applicant – a well-known figure whose alleged illegal activities had already been\\nthe focus of media attention – complained that the Swedish courts had failed to provide\\ndue protection for his name and reputation following the publication, by two main\\nevening newspapers in Sweden, of a series of articles in which the applicant was accused\\nof various criminal offences, including the murder of the Swedish Prime Minister\\nten years before.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention. It noted in particular that, in the series of articles, the\\nnewspapers had endeavoured to present an account of the various allegations made\\nwhich was as balanced as possible and that the journalists had acted in good faith. It\\nalso considered that the Swedish courts had made a thorough examination of the case\\nand balanced the opposing interests involved. In the present case, the Court found that\\nthe domestic courts had been justified in finding that the public interest in publishing the\\ninformation in question outweighed the applicant’s right to the protection of his\\nreputation. Consequently, there had been no failure on the part of the Swedish State to\\nafford adequate protection of the applicant’s rights.\\nA. v. Norway (no. 28070/06)\\n9 April 2009\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s complaint about the unfavourable outcome of a\\ndefamation suit he had brought against a newspaper, following their publication of news\\ncoverage about the preliminary investigations into the rape and murder of two young\\ngirls (the so-called Baneheia case) in 2000 and which implicated him. The applicant was\\nquestioned about the murders but released after 10 hours; two other men were\\nsubsequently convicted of the crimes.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the Norwegian courts had failed to strike a fair\\nbalance between the newspaper’s freedom of expression and the applicant’s right to\\nrespect for his private life. The Court considered in particular that the news report had\\nwrongly conveyed the idea that there had been facts pointing to the applicant as a\\nsuspect. While it had been undisputed that the press had the right to deliver information\\nto the public, and the public had the right to receive such information, these\\nconsiderations did not justify the defamatory allegations against the applicant and the\\nconsequent harm done to him. Indeed, the applicant had been persecuted by journalists\\nin order to obtain his pictures and interviews, and in particular during a period in his life\\nwhen he had been undergoing rehabilitation and reintegration into society. As a result of\\nthe journalistic reports, he had found himself unable to continue his work, had to leave\\nhis home and had been driven into social exclusion. The publications in question had\\ntherefore gravely damaged the applicant’s reputation and honour and had been\\nespecially harmful to his moral and psychological integrity and to his private life.\\nPrivate persons\\nSanchez Cardenas v. Norway\\n4 October 2007\\nIn 1995 the applicant separated from the mother of his two sons. In June 1997 a dispute\\narose concerning access to his children following allegations made by the mother to the\\npolice which accused the applicant of having sexually abused one of the children.\\nThe investigation into those allegations was discontinued in 1998. The applicant\\ncomplained about the unfairness of a High Court judgment in 2002 to refuse his right of\\naccess to his children, alleging in particular that a passage from the judgment amounted\\nto an affirmation of suspicion that he had abused his son. He further claimed that,\\n35Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nhaving been labelled a sexual abuser, he was suffering from anxiety and depression, as\\ncorroborated by medical reports.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that that the impugned passage from the High Court\\njudgment had not been sufficiently justified in the circumstances and had been\\ndisproportionate to the aims pursued. It was in particular not apparent why the High\\nCourt had mentioned that abuse might have occurred, thus confirming a suspicion of its\\nown that the applicant had committed a serious crime, but had decided not to go any\\nfurther into the matter. In the Court’s opinion, that court should either have dealt with\\nthe issue of sexual abuse fully (i.e. by examining evidence and coming to a reasoned\\nconclusion) or left it to one side. Such an authoritative judicial decision concerning his\\nconduct had stigmatised the applicant, had had a major impact on his honour and\\nreputation and prejudiced his private and family life.\\nPolanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain\\n21 September 2010\\nThe applicants were respectively the wife and daughter of a senior judge who died in\\n1998. The case concerned an article published in the national daily newspaper El Mundo\\nin 1994 accusing the first applicant, on basis of remarks by a former accountant, of\\ninvolvement in improper dealings with a company. The applicants alleged that in finding\\nin favour of El Mundo the Spanish courts had infringed their honour and good reputation.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, finding that the Spanish Constitutional Court had put\\nforward sufficient grounds in finding that the national newspaper’s right to impart\\ninformation had to be given more weight than the applicants’ right to the protection of\\ntheir reputation and that, accordingly, there was no reason to conclude, in the balancing\\nof the competing interests, that the Constitutional Court had overstepped its margin of\\nappreciation. The Court observed in particular that impugned article had the\\ncharacteristics of a neutral report, containing on the one hand the statements of the\\nformer accountant and on the other a denial by the judge’s wife. In addition, the\\npublication of an article could not be prevented simply because the persons concerned\\ndenied the allegations therein. Furthermore, it had been reasonable for the journalist to\\nrely on the sources at his disposal and he had taken sufficient measures to verify the\\nallegations contained in his article.\\nMikolajová v. Slovakia\\n18 January 2011\\nIn 2000 the applicant’s husband filed a complaint with the police alleging that she had\\nbeaten and wounded him. The case was, however, later dropped as he did not agree to\\ncriminal proceedings being brought against her. The applicant complained about the\\nensuing decision issued by the police stating that, although the investigation showed\\nthat she had committed a criminal offence, criminal prosecution was barred since the\\nvictim did not consent to it. She discovered that decision a year and a half later, when a\\nhealth insurance company referred to it in its request for her to reimburse the costs of\\nher husband’s medical treatment following the injuries she had inflicted on him.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the Slovakian authorities had failed to strike a fair\\nbalance between the applicant’s Article 8 rights and any interests relied on by the\\nGovernment to justify the terms of the police decision and its disclosure to a third party.\\nThe Court observed in particular that the police decision had been formulated as a\\nstatement of fact thus indicating that the police considered the applicant guilty of the\\nalleged offence. Even though she had never been charged with a criminal offence, the\\napplicant was nonetheless placed on record as a criminal offender possibly for an\\nindefinite period, which must have caused damage to her reputation. Moreover, the\\nCourt could not but note the lack of any procedural safeguards in that the applicant had\\n36Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nno available recourse to obtain a subsequent retraction or clarification of the impugned\\npolice decision.\\nAgeyevy v. Russia14\\n18 April 2013\\nIn 2008 the applicants, a married couple, adopted two small children (a boy and a girl).\\nFollowing an incident in March 2009 in which the boy was badly burnt at home and had\\nto go to hospital for treatment, the authorities took the children into care as they\\nsuspected abuse. The mother complained in particular that the Russian courts had failed\\nto protect her reputation in defamation proceedings she had instituted in respect of\\nmedia reports describing her alleged ill-treatment of her son.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention on account of the Russian courts’ failure to protect the mother’s\\nright to reputation in the defamation proceedings against the media company concerned,\\nas it was not convinced that the reasons advanced by the courts regarding the protection\\nof the freedom of expression of the media company had outweighed the mother’s rights\\nto have her reputation and right to the presumption of innocence safeguarded. It was in\\nparticular not evident that the domestic courts in the defamation proceedings had\\nattached any importance to the right to the presumption of innocence. Nor had they\\nexamined closely whether the journalists had acted in good faith and had provided\\nreliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism. Moreover,\\neven though nothing in the case-file suggested that the journalists had not been acting\\nin good faith, they had obviously failed to take the necessary steps to report the incident\\nin an objective and rigorous manner, trying instead either to exaggerate or oversimplify\\nthe underlying reality.\\nPopovski v. “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”\\n31 October 2013\\nThis case concerned an article about the applicant published in a daily newspaper,\\nsuggesting that he had stolen a tractor, and the subsequent proceedings for defamation.\\nThe applicant complained in particular that by not ensuring the attendance at trial of the\\nindividuals that he claimed had defamed him the national courts had failed to protect his\\nreputation, which had been considerably damaged by the article in question.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the manner in which the criminal-law mechanism\\nhad been implemented in the applicant’s case had been defective to the point of\\nconstituting a breach of the respondent State’s positive obligations arising under Article\\n8 to ensure effective respect for the applicant’s private life, in particular his right to\\nrespect for his reputation.\\nPutistin v. Ukraine\\n21 November 2013\\nThis case concerned an article written about the legendary “Death Match” between\\nUkrainian footballers and members of the German Luftwaffe in 1942 in Kyiv.\\nThe applicant alleged that the article discredited his father, who had played in the game,\\nas it suggested that he had been a collaborator. He claimed that, by rejecting his\\nrequests for the article to be rectified, the Ukrainian courts had failed to protect his and\\nhis family’s reputation.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, finding that the Ukrainian courts had struck a fair balance\\nbetween the applicant’s right to respect for his private life, and the right of the\\nnewspaper and journalist to freedom of expression. The Court observed in particular that\\ncourts might sometimes be required to protect the reputation of the deceased. It further\\naccepted that the reputation of a deceased member of a person’s family might affect\\nthat person’s private life and identity, and thus came within the scope of Article 8.\\n14.

They complained in particular that\\nthe Constitutional Court had failed to strike a fair balance between their own right to\\nrespect for their private and family life and the author of the novel’s right to freedom\\nof expression.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible under Article 8 (right to respect of\\nprivate life) of the Convention, as being manifestly ill-founded, finding that the\\napplicants’ reputation had not been seriously affected in the present case. It considered\\nin particular that the Slovenian courts’ approach – consisting in assessing whether the\\nstory would have been perceived as either real or offensive by an average reader – had\\nbeen reasonable and consistent with its own case-law. Therefore, it concluded that a fair\\nbalance had been struck between the competing interests at stake, namely the\\napplicants’ right to respect for private and family life and the author’s right to freedom\\nof expression.\\nSõro v. Estonia\\n3 September 2015\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s complaint about the fact that information about\\nhis employment during the Soviet era as a driver for the Committee for State Security of\\nthe USSR (the KGB) had been published in the Estonian State Gazette in 2004.\\nThe Court held that there had been violation of Article 8 (right to respect of private\\nlife) of the Convention. It observed in particular that the publication of information about\\nthe applicant’s employment as a driver of the KGB had affected his reputation and\\ntherefore constituted an interference with his right to respect for his private life. The\\ninterference – which had been based on the Disclosure Act – was admittedly lawful and\\nhad pursued a legitimate aim for the purpose of Article 8, namely the protection of\\nnational security and public safety, the prevention of disorder and the protection of the\\nrights and freedoms of others. The Court however found that in the applicant’s case the\\nmeasure had been disproportionate to the aims sought. In this regard, it noted in\\nparticular that, under the relevant national legislation, information about all employees\\nof the former security services – including drivers, as in the applicant’s case – was\\npublished, regardless of the specific function they had performed. In the present case,\\nalthough the Disclosure Act itself did not impose any restrictions on the applicant’s\\nemployment, according to his submissions he had been derided by his colleagues and\\nhad been forced to quit his job. Even if such a result was not sought by the Act\\nit nevertheless testified to how serious the interference with the applicant’s right\\nto respect for his private life had been.\\nLewit v. Austria\\n10 October 2019\\nThis case concerned a now 96-year-old Holocaust survivor’s complaint that he had been\\ndefamed by a right-wing periodical and that the Austrian courts had failed in their duty\\nto protect his reputation from the false and defamatory statements made\\nin the periodical in question.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention finding that, overall, the lack of a proper examination by\\nthe courts of the applicant’s defamation claim had led to a violation of his privacy rights.\\nIt noted in particular that the courts had failed to protect the applicant’s rights because\\nthey had never dealt with the central issue of his claim: that he had been defamed by an\\narticle which had used terms like “mass murderers”, “criminals” and “a plague” to\\n38Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\ndescribe people like him liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp complex in\\n1945. Instead, the courts had concluded that he had no standing to bring the case at all\\nas the number of people liberated had been so large that he could not have been\\npersonally affected by statements in which he had not been named. However, the courts\\nhad not examined the fact that by the time of the article there were far fewer survivors\\nstill alive. The courts had also concluded that the article had simply repeated statements\\nmade in an earlier piece on the same theme and thus the words had had no separate\\ndefamatory meaning. The Court found that no explanation had been provided for\\nthat finding and concluded that in fact the context and purpose of the two articles was\\nvery different.\\nMarina v. Romania\\n26 mai 2020\\nThis case concerned a radio programme during which a letter was read out containing\\npersonal information about the applicant – a police superintendent not known to\\nthe general public – and his ex-wife, without their knowledge and on the initiative of\\nthe applicant’s sister. After the broadcast the radio station was obliged to publish\\na retraction, having realised that the information on the applicant was false. However,\\na civil liability suit brought by the latter against the broadcaster was dismissed, as the\\nCounty Court took the view that where questions of public interest concerning public\\nfigures were at stake, those individuals had to show a greater degree of tolerance\\nin view of their position in society.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention. It noted, in particular, that the County Court had not properly\\nweighed up the competing rights: the right to impart ideas and the right to have one’s\\nrights and reputation protected. In the applicant’s case, the Court found that, in\\nweighing up the interests at stake, the County Court had not taken account of the actual\\ncontent of the information, its contribution to a debate on a general interest, or its lack\\nof factual basis. The Court also observed that the County Court had not explained how\\nthe mere fact of holding the post of police superintendent had reduced his expectation to\\nthe protection of his private life.\\nM.L. v. Slovakia (no. 34159/17)\\n14 October 2021\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of an action instituted by the applicant against\\ntabloids, which had published unverified tawdry statements on, and pictures of, her son,\\na priest who had been convicted of sexual offences, years after his death.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the Slovakian courts had failed to carry out a\\nbalancing exercise between the applicant’s right to private life and the newspaper\\npublishers’ freedom of expression in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court’s\\ncase-law. The Court noted, in particular, that the distorted facts and the expressions\\nused must have been upsetting for the applicant and they had been of such a nature as\\nto be capable of considerably and directly affecting her feelings as a mother of a\\ndeceased son as well as her private life and identity, the reputation of her deceased son\\nbeing a part and parcel thereof.\\nRamadan v. France\\n9 January 2024 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the applicant’s conviction for having disseminated information about\\nthe identity of the presumed victim of a rape for which he was facing trial.\\nThe Court declared inadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, the applicant’s\\ncomplaint under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention, finding that,\\nhaving regard to the respondent State’s wide margin of appreciation, the impugned\\ninterference with the applicant’s freedom of expression had been proportionate to the\\nlegitimate aim pursued. In particular, as to the legitimate aim pursued – to protect the\\ndignity and private life of the victim of a sexual offence and avoid pressure on him or\\n39Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nher –, the Court noted that the present case concerned “the protection of the reputation\\nor rights of others”, namely those of the presumed victim.\\nProfessionals\\nBusinessmen\\nPipi v. Turkey\\n12 May 2009 (decision on admissibility)\\nThe applicant in this case, a businessman, complained about a press article and a\\ntelevision programme which impugned his reputation. He alleged in particular that the\\nimparting of the information in question had unjustifiably interfered with his right to\\nrespect for his private life, especially as the comments did not reflect reality and did not\\npresent any interest for public opinion.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.\\nAs regards the impugned article and programme, it observed in particular that they had\\nimparted a series of speculations based on a judicial event, presented in the manner of a\\nrumour, which was typical of the media in question, but that the information did not\\nconcern purely personal details of the applicant’s life and was not the result of an\\nintolerable and continuous intrusion therein. Such information could not therefore have\\nconstituted, for the applicant’s private life, an interference of such seriousness that his\\npersonal integrity was undermined, and only his reputation could have been affected.\\nExamining the position taken by the Turkish courts on that point, the Court found that\\nthere was nothing to suggest that they had exceeded their margin of appreciation when\\nthey nuanced the weight of the applicant’s right to the protection of his private life,\\nwithin the meaning of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of\\nthe Convention, when placed in the balance against the competing interests of the media\\nin question, in the light of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention.\\nDoctors, veterinaries and health workers\\nFürst-Pfeifer v. Austria\\n17 May 2016\\nThe applicant, a psychiatrist, complained that the Austrian courts had failed to protect\\nher reputation against defamatory allegations made in a newspaper article which stated\\nin particular that she suffered from psychological problems such as mood swings and\\npanic attacks but had been working as a court-appointed expert for many years.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, finding that the Austrian courts had struck a fair balance\\nbetween the competing interests in the present case.\\nDaneş and Others v. Romania\\n7 December 2021\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of civil claims brought by the applicants, members\\nof the management board of the National Order of Veterinary Surgeons of Romania\\n(C.M.V.R.), against a journalist and a local weekly newspaper, with a view to securing\\nprotection of their reputation following the publication of an article containing criticisms\\nof them. The applicants argued that the national authorities had failed to protect\\ntheir reputation.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, finding that the national courts had struck a fair balance\\nbetween the applicants’ right to respect for their private life and the journalist’s right to\\nfreedom of expression, and had assessed these competing interests in the light of the\\ncriteria set out in its case-law. Taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to\\nthe Contracting Parties, it thus saw no serious reason to substitute its own opinion for\\nthat of the Romanian courts. Accordingly, it could not be said that by refusing to grant\\nthe applicants’ request the domestic courts had failed to fulfil the Romanian State’s\\npositive obligation to protect the applicants’ right to respect for their private life.\\n40Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nSee also, among others:\\nAbbasaliyeva v. Azerbaijan\\n27 April 2023\\nJournalists\\nPfeifer v. Austria\\n15 November 2007\\nChief editor of the official magazine of the Vienna Jewish community, the applicant\\npublished a commentary criticising in harsh terms a professor who had written an article\\nalleging that the Jews had declared war on Germany in 1933 and which trivialised the\\ncrimes of the Nazi regime. Proceedings were brought against the professor,\\nwho committed suicide shortly before the date scheduled for his trial. The applicant\\nalleged that the Austrian courts had failed to protect his reputation against defamatory\\nstatements made by the chief editor of another magazine, who had stated, in particular,\\nthat the applicant and others had hunted the professor to his death.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, as it was not convinced that the reasons advanced by the\\nAustrian courts for protecting freedom of expression outweighed the applicant's right to\\nprotection of his reputation. It observed in particular that, even in the context of a public\\ndebate, a person's reputation formed part of his or her personal identity and\\npsychological integrity and so fell within the scope of his or her “private life”.\\nThe domestic courts had considered the impugned statement to be a value judgement\\nwith a sufficient factual basis to avoid being defamatory. The Court was not convinced by\\nthat assessment, as the statement clearly established a causal link between the\\napplicant's actions and the professor's suicide. Such a link was not a matter of\\nspeculation, but a fact susceptible of proof and no evidence of its existence had been\\noffered. Further, while it was true that even statements that shocked or offended were\\nprotected by the right to freedom of expression, the statement here had overstepped\\nacceptable limits by accusing the applicant of acts tantamount to criminal behaviour in\\nthat it was alleged that he had ultimately driven the professor to suicide.\\nSipoş v. Romania\\n3 May 2011\\nThis case concerned a press release published by the management of the Romanian\\nState TV channel, after removing the applicant from a programme that she produced\\nand presented. She claimed that the press release had infringed her right to her\\nreputation and should have been condemned by the Romanian courts.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the assertions complained of by the applicant had\\noverstepped the acceptable limit and that the Romanian courts had not struck a fair\\nbalance between the protection of her right to her reputation and the freedom of\\nexpression protected by Article 10 of the Convention.\\nJudges\\nÖzpınar v. Turkey\\n19 October 2010\\nThe applicant was removed from office as a judge by a decision of the Supreme Council\\nof the Judiciary following a disciplinary investigation concerning, among other subjects,\\nher alleged close relationships with several men, her appearance and her repeated\\nlateness for work. The applicant alleged in particular that she had been dismissed on the\\nbasis of rumours and accusations impugning her honour and reputation.\\nThe Court observed that the decision to remove the applicant from office was directly\\nrelated to her conduct, both professionally and in private. Moreover, her reputation had\\nbeen impugned. There had therefore been an interference with her right to respect for\\nher private life and it could be said to have had a legitimate aim, in relation to the duty\\n41Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nof judges to exercise restraint in order to preserve their independence and the authority\\nof their decisions. Finding that in the present case the interference with the applicant’s\\nprivate life had not been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the Court held that\\nthere had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of the\\nConvention. Admittedly, the Court noted, the ethical obligations of judges might\\nencroach upon their private life when their conduct tarnished the image or reputation of\\nthe judiciary. However, the applicant nevertheless remained a private person entitled to\\nArticle 8 protection and, even if certain aspects of the conduct attributed to her might\\nhave warranted her removal, the investigation had not substantiated those accusations\\nand had taken into account numerous actions that were unrelated to her\\nprofessional activity.\\nOleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine\\n9 January 2013\\nThis case concerned the dismissal of a Supreme Court Judge. The applicant complained\\nin particular that his dismissal from the post of judge had been an interference with\\nhis private and professional life.\\nThe Court observed in particular that the dismissal of the applicant from the post of\\njudge had affected a wide range of his relationships with other persons, including\\nrelationships of a professional nature. Likewise, it had an impact on his “inner circle” as\\nthe loss of his job must have had tangible consequences for the material well-being of\\nthe applicant and his family. Moreover, the reason for the applicant’s dismissal, namely\\nbreach of the judicial oath, suggested that his professional reputation was affected. It\\nfollowed that the applicant’s dismissal had constituted an interference with his right to\\nrespect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of\\nthe Convention. In the applicant’s case, the Court held that there had been a violation\\nof Article 8, finding that the interference with his right to respect for his private life had\\nnot been lawful: the interference had not been compatible with domestic law and,\\nmoreover, the applicable domestic law had failed to satisfy the requirements of\\nforeseeability and provision of appropriate protection against arbitrariness.\\nDanileţ v. Romania\\n20 February 202415\\nThis case concerned a disciplinary sanction imposed on a judge by the National Judicial\\nand Legal Service Commission for posting two messages on his Facebook account.\\nThe applicant complained of a violation of his right to freedom of expression. He further\\nsubmitted that the disciplinary sanction had damaged his social and professional\\nreputation and had had a negative impact on his career.\\nIn the present case, the Court found that the grounds for the sanction were unrelated to\\nthe applicant’s “private life” and that it had not had severe negative consequences for\\nhis “inner circle”, for his ability to form and develop relationships with others or for his\\nreputation. Consequently, it held that Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of the\\nConvention was not applicable in the present case and declared the complaint under that\\nhead inadmissible. On the other hand, the Court held that there had been a violation\\nof Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention in respect of the applicant,\\nfinding that the Romanian courts had not provided relevant and sufficient reasons to\\njustify the alleged interference with his right to freedom of expression.\\nLawyers\\nWegrzynowski and Smolczewski v. Poland\\n16 July 2013\\nThis case concerned the complaint by two lawyers that a newspaper article damaging to\\ntheir reputation – which the Polish courts, in previous libel proceedings, had found to be\\nbased on insufficient information and in breach of their rights – remained accessible to\\nthe public on the newspaper’s website.\\n15. This judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 of the Convention.\\n42Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention as regards the second applicant, finding that the Polish\\ncourts had struck a fair balance between the public’s right to access to information on\\nthe one hand and the applicant’s right to have his reputation protected on the other. It\\nconsidered in particular that completely removing the contested article from the\\nnewspaper’s archive would have been disproportionate; at the same time, the applicant\\nhad not requested for a reference to the judgments in his favour to be added to the\\narticle online. The Court further declared the first applicant’s complaint inadmissible, as\\nhe had failed to lodge his complaint within the required time-limit, six months after the\\nlast decision of the Polish courts.\\nJankauskas v. Lithuania (no. 2) and Lekavičienė v. Lithuania\\n27 June 2017\\nThese cases concerned the refusal by the Lithuanian Bar Association to include the two\\napplicants in its list of advocates. The applicant in the first case was struck off the list of\\ntrainee advocates, after it emerged that he had failed to declare a previous conviction in\\nhis application to be included in the list. The applicant in the second case was refused re-\\nadmittance to the list of practicing advocates, on the grounds that she had previously\\nbeen convicted of defrauding the publicly-funded legal aid system. Both applicants\\ncomplained that the prohibition on their practicing law had violated their right to\\nprivate life.\\nIn both cases the Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to\\nrespect for private life) of the Convention. The Court examined in particular the\\nexclusion of the applicants from the list of advocates as an interference with their right\\nto respect for private life, as it must have affected their professional reputation and\\nrelationships. However, the findings of the domestic authorities – that the applicants had\\nnot possessed a sufficiently high moral character – had been consistent with domestic\\nlaw and had not been unreasonable in the circumstances. The interference with the\\napplicants’ private lives had therefore been justifiable, in order to protect the rights of\\nothers by ensuring the good and proper functioning of the justice system.\\nHøiness v. Norway\\n19 March 2019\\nThis case concerned the Norwegian courts’ refusal to impose civil liability on an Internet\\nforum host after vulgar comments about the applicant, a well-known lawyer, had been\\nposted on the forum. The applicant complained that the authorities had violated her\\nrights by not sufficiently protecting her right to protection of her reputation and by\\nrequiring her to pay litigation costs to the extent seen in her case.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, findind that the Norwegian courts had sufficiently\\nsafeguarded the applicant’s rights under that provision. It noted in particular that the\\ncomments made about the applicant had been found by the City Court not to constitute\\ndefamation under national law, while the High Court had deemed it unnecessary to take\\na stand on whether they were defamatory or not, and considered that the national courts\\nhad acted within their discretion (“margin of appreciation”) when seeking to establish a\\nbalance between the applicant’s rights under Article 8 and the opposing right to freedom\\nof expression under Article 10 of the Convention of the news portal and host of the\\ndebate forums. Moreover, the domestic courts’ rulings on litigation costs being awarded\\nto the defendants had not as such violated Article 8 of the Convention.\\nAlmeida Arroja v. Portugal\\n19 March 202416\\nThe case concerned the criminal conviction of the applicant – an economist and\\nuniversity professor, who, at the relevant time, was a weekly political commentator on a\\ndaily news programme broadcast by the private television channel “Porto Canal” – for\\n16. This judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 of the Convention.\\n43Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\naggravated defamation and causing offence to a legal entity. He had implied, during a\\nbroadcast, that a legal opinion provided to a public hospital by a law firm, whose director\\nhappened to be a well-known politician and member of the European Parliament,\\nhad been motivated by political interests.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention in respect of the applicant, finding that, overall, the national courts had\\nnot balance the rights at stake in accordance with its case-law. The Court noted in\\nparticular that the statements had been part of a broad critique on links between politics\\nand public administration and as such had not been statements of facts. In addition, the\\ninterference with the applicant’s rights had not been supported by relevant and sufficient\\nreasons, and disproportionate weight had been given to the reputation of the law firm\\nand its director. The national courts had therefore exceeded their discretion (“margin\\nof appreciation”).\\nMembers of the armed forces\\nSağdıç v. Turkey\\n9 February 2021\\nThe applicant, who was a career officer in the armed forces at the relevant time, alleged\\na breach of his right to protection of his reputation on account of a series of articles\\npublished in two daily newspapers, accusing him of involvement in an action plan\\ncodenamed “Cage”, allegedly aimed at creating conditions favourable to the overthrow of\\nthe government. He maintained that the allegations contained in the articles in question\\nwere unfounded and slanderous.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the Turkish courts had failed to protect the\\napplicant’s right to respect for his private life against the damage caused by the\\nimpugned press articles. It noted, in particular, that in view of the seriousness of the\\nallegations contained in the articles in question, which accused the applicant of serious\\ncriminal acts, the damage to his reputation attained the threshold of gravity required to\\nbring it within the scope of Article 8. The Court went on to find that the domestic courts\\nhad not carried out a proper balancing exercise between the applicant’s right to respect\\nfor his private life on the one hand and freedom of press on the other; that the content\\nof the articles had been incompatible with the standards of responsible journalism; and\\nthat the domestic courts should have displayed greater rigour in weighing up the various\\ninterests at stake. The courts had not given sufficient consideration to the seriousness of\\nthe breach of the applicant’s right to protection of his reputation resulting from the\\npublication of allegations accusing him of particularly grave acts and liable to expose him\\nto public condemnation.\\nPolice officers\\nKyriakides v. Cyprus and Taliadorou and Stylianou v. Cyprus\\n16 October 2008\\nThe applicants were pensioners of the Cyprus police, within which they had the rank of\\nsuperior officer. The cases concerned the annulment by the Cypriot Supreme Court of\\ncompensation for damage caused to their integrity and reputation by allegations of\\ntorture. The applicants, who had been dismissed from the police force by a decision\\nwhich had been widely reported in the press, were subsequently reinstated in their\\nformer posts.\\nIn both cases the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to\\nrespect for private life) of the Convention. While it was not the Court’s role to interpret\\nthe Constitutional provision under which the applicants had sought compensation for the\\ninjury to their integrity and reputation, the Court found that the Cypriot Supreme Court\\nhad failed to provide an adequate explanation for the reversal of the award of moral\\ndamages and noted that the absence of a comprehensive assessment as regards a\\nmatter affecting the applicants’ Article 8 rights was not consonant with an acceptable\\n44Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nmargin of appreciation. There had therefore been a breach of the State’s procedural\\nobligations in the present case.\\nTeachers and university lecturers\\nIon Cârstea v. Romania\\n28 October 2014\\nThis case concerned the publication in a local newspaper of an article about the\\napplicant, a university professor, which described in detail an incident in his sex life 19\\nyears before and accusing him of bribery, blackmail, child sex abuse and sexual\\ndeviance. The applicant alleged that the domestic courts had failed to protect his\\nreputation following the publication of the article and accompanying pictures. He notably\\nsubmitted that the courts had failed, when assessing his complaint, to verify the\\ntruthfulness of the facts contained in the article.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the Romanian courts had not carefully balanced the\\njournalist’s right to freedom of expression against the applicant’s right to respect for his\\nprivate life. In particular there could be little doubt that the disputed article and\\naccompanying photographs had seriously prejudiced the applicant’s honour and\\nreputation and had been harmful to his psychological integrity and private life. The Court\\nwas further not convinced that the national courts had attached the required importance\\nto the questions whether the article had contributed to a debate of general interest and\\nwhether the applicant should have been regarded as a public figure.\\nVicent Del Campo v. Spain\\n6 November 2018\\nThis case concerned a domestic judgement which named the applicant as having\\nharassed a work colleague, although the defendant in the case was actually his local\\nauthority employer. The applicant complained in particular that the High Court judgment\\nstating that he had committed harassment, in proceedings in which he was not a party,\\nhad amounted to an unjustified interference with his right to honour and reputation.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that, overall, the interference with the applicant’s right to\\nrespect for his private life had not been properly justified . The Court noted in particular\\nthat there had been no good reason to name the applicant in the judgment, which had\\nled to him being stigmatised in proceedings to which he was not a party. He had only\\nfound about the judgment from the local press and had had no chance to request that\\nhis name not be disclosed in the judgment handed down by the High Court in question.\\nPublic persons or political figures\\nPetrina v. Romania\\n14 October 2008\\nThe applicant, a politician, was alleged to have been a Securitate agent in a television\\nprogramme on a bill relating to access to information stored in the archives of the former\\nState security services (“the Securitate”) and two subsequent articles in a humorous\\nmagazine. He lodged two criminal complaints against the journalists concerned for\\ninsulting remarks and defamation. Following the journalists’ acquittal by the domestic\\ncourts, the applicant complained that his right to respect for his honour and his good\\nname had been violated.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, as it was not satisfied that the reasons given by the Romanian\\ncourts for protecting freedom of expression were sufficient to take precedence over the\\napplicant’s reputation. They had accordingly failed to strike a fair balance between the\\ncompeting interests at stake. The Court noted in particular that, despite the satirical\\ncharacter of the magazine, the articles in question had been liable to offend the\\napplicant, as there was no evidence that he had ever belonged to the Securitate.\\n45Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nMoreover, the impugned remarks made accusations that directly concerned the applicant\\nin his personal, not professional, capacity. Accordingly, this was not a case of journalists\\nindulging in the measure of exaggeration or provocation they were allowed in the\\ncontext of press freedom. Furthermore, in the Court’s view, the journalists’ allegations\\nhad overstepped the bounds of the acceptable, accusing the applicant of having\\nbelonged to a group that used repression and terror to serve the old regime as a political\\npolice instrument. In addition, there had been no legislative framework at the relevant\\ntime allowing the public access to Securitate files, a state of affairs for which the\\napplicant could not be held responsible.\\nKarakó v. Hungary\\n28 April 2009\\nA Member of Parliament, the applicant complained of the Hungarian authorities’ failure to\\nprotect his right to private life by refusing to act upon his criminal complaint against\\nanother politician who, during the 2002 parliamentary elections, had distributed a flyer\\ncontaining criticism of the applicant’s conduct as regards major decisions in his county.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, finding that the negative remarks at issue, made against\\nthe applicant by another politician, were compatible with domestic law and the\\nConvention. The applicant had failed to establish that the publication which had allegedly\\ntarnished his reputation had caused such serious damage to his private life that his\\npersonal integrity had been undermined. His reputation alone was at stake. If the\\ndomestic courts had imposed a sanction on the politician in question for the remarks\\nmade in his leaflet they would have unduly restricted his freedom of expression, thus\\nleading to a breach of his rights under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of\\nthe Convention.\\nPetrenco v. the Republic of Moldova\\n30 March 2010\\nAt the time of the events, the applicant was the Chairman of the Association of\\nHistorians of the Republic of Moldova and a university professor. He complained that his\\nreputation was damaged as a result of the publication, in April 2002, of statements in\\nthe official newspaper of the Moldovan Government, implying that he had collaborated\\nwith the KGB.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that the reasons advanced by the Moldovan tribunals to\\nprotect the right to freedom of expression of the newspaper and the author of the\\nimpugned article were insufficient to outweigh the applicant's right to respect for his\\nreputation. The Court observed in particular that the article had been published in the\\ncontext of a lively debate of significant public interest and that the applicant, who was a\\npublic figure, had had to tolerate higher public scrutiny and criticism than had he been a\\nprivate citizen. Therefore the general tone of the article and the insulting language had\\nnot in themselves breached the applicant’s right to respect for his reputation. However,\\nby implying that the applicant had collaborated with the KGB as though it had been an\\nestablished fact when it had been a mere speculation on the part of the author, the\\narticle had overstepped the limits of acceptable comments in the context of a debate of a\\ngeneral interest.\\nHoon v. the United Kingdom\\n13 November 2014 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the investigation by parliamentary authorities into the applicant, a\\nformer government minister, after he had been involved in an undercover “sting”\\noperation by a journalist posing as a prospective business associate. During the sting\\noperation the applicant was recorded as stating that he was willing to use knowledge and\\ncontacts gained during his period as a minister and as a special advisor to the Secretary\\nGeneral of NATO for financial reward. Details were subsequently published by a\\nnewspaper and broadcast in a television documentary. Following a formal complaint by\\n46Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nan opposition Member of Parliament, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards\\nissued a report in which he found that the applicant had breached the Code of Conduct\\nfor Members of Parliament and brought Parliament into disrepute. The applicant\\ncomplained in particular about the widely publicised decisions of the Commissioner\\nagainst him as approved by the Standards and Privileges Committee and the House\\nof Commons.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible. As regards the applicant’s complaint\\nunder Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of the Convention, it was satisfied that\\nthe interference with the applicant’s private life, that is the damage caused to his\\nreputation by the investigation and report, had been proportionate to the interests of the\\npublic in being aware of such proceedings and their outcome. In particular the Court\\nnoted in this case that the reduced level of legal protection of the right to reputation\\nresulting from the rule of parliamentary immunity under British law was consistent with\\nand reflected generally recognised rules within Contracting States, the Council of Europe\\nand the European Union and could not in principle be regarded as a disproportionate\\nrestriction on the right to respect for private life. In any event, the facts relative to the\\ninterference were already in the public domain as a result of the newspaper article and\\nthe television programme and the applicant could have challenged the factual allegation\\nby bringing proceedings against the newspaper or the broadcaster. The Court also\\nrejected the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention,\\nfinding that the parliamentary proceedings in question did not attract the application of\\nthe right to a fair hearing because they did not determine or give rise to a dispute as to\\nthe applicant’s civil rights.\\nRubio Dosamantes v. Spain\\n21 February 2017\\nThe applicant, a Mexican pop singer who is very well known in Spain under the name of\\nPaulina Rubio, complained of remarks made during various television programmes on\\nher private life. She submitted that her reputation and private life had been harmed by\\nthese remarks.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention, finding that, having regard to the margin of appreciation afforded\\nto the authorities when it came to weighing up the various interests, they had failed in\\ntheir positive obligations to ensure the protection of the applicant’s privacy. The Court\\nnoted in particular that the applicant’s fame as a singer did not mean that her activities\\nor conduct in her private life should be regarded as necessarily falling within the public\\ninterest. The fact that she could have benefitted from media attention did not authorise\\nTV channels to broadcast unchecked comments about her private life. In this judgment\\nthe Court also reiterated that certain events of private and family life were given\\nparticularly careful protection under Article 8 of the Convention, meaning that journalists\\nhad to show prudence and precaution when talking about them. Thus the spreading of\\nunverified rumours or the limitless broadcasting of random comments on any possible\\naspect of a person’s daily life could not be seen as harmless. Lastly, the Court found that\\nthe national authorities should have assessed the TV programmes in question, to\\ndistinguish between and to weigh in the balance those matters which were intimately\\npart of the applicant’s private life and those which might have had a legitimate\\npublic interest.\\nHaupt v. Austria\\n2 May 2017 (decision on the admissibility)\\nIn an episode of the satirical comedy show Das Letze der Woche (which aired in\\nSeptember 2003), the host suggested that the applicant – who was Chairperson of the\\nAustrian Freedom Party between 2002 and 2004 and Vice Chancellor of the Federal\\nGovernment between February and October 2003 – was “usually surrounded by little\\nbrown rats”. This was regarded as an allusion to neo-Nazis. The applicant brought\\nproceedings in Austria against ATV, the television company which had broadcast the\\n47Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nprogramme. Though his claim had been initially successful in 2004-5, his case was\\nultimately rejected after the Supreme Court re-opened proceedings in 2009. The\\napplicant complained in particular that, by rejecting his claim, the Austrian courts had\\nviolated his right to protection of reputation.\\nThe Court declared this complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, finding\\nthat the Austrian courts had struck a fair balance between the applicant’s right to\\nprotection of reputation and ATV’s right to freedom of expression. In particular, the\\nCourt noted that the reference to “brown rats” around the applicant had not been a\\npersonal criticism of him. Instead, it had been a political criticism of his attitude towards\\nother members of his party. This satirical value judgment had had a sufficient factual\\nbasis, given the various problematic statements made by politicians of the Austrian\\nFreedom Party which had been recorded by the Austrian courts. The Court also declared\\ninadmissible the applicant’s complaint that the proceedings concerning his\\ncompensation claim had exceeded a reasonable length and his complaint that the re-\\nopening of the proceedings had violated his right to property.\\nEgill Einarsson v. Iceland\\n7 November 2017\\nThis case concerned the complaint by a well-known blogger about a Supreme Court\\nruling, which found that he had not been defamed by the words “Fuck you rapist\\nbastard” used in an Instagram post about him. Prosecutors had just before dismissed\\nrape and sexual offence accusations against him. The applicant complained that the\\nSupreme Court judgment meant that he could be called a rapist without being charged\\nor convicted of such a crime and without being able to defend himself.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nlife) of the Convention finding that, overall, the domestic courts had not struck a fair\\nbalance between the applicant’s right to respect for his private life under Article 8 and\\nthe right to freedom of expression under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the\\nConvention of the person who had posted the remark. It considered in particular that the\\ndomestic courts had not taken sufficient account of the fact that the remarks, notably\\nthe word “rapist”, had been posted just a week after prosecutors had discontinued\\nsexual offence proceedings against the applicant. The courts had further not provided a\\nsufficient explanation in the context of the case for their justification for finding that the\\nword “rapist” could be used as a value judgment. The Court also underlined that Article 8\\nof the Convention had to be interpreted to mean that even public persons who had\\nbegun a heated debate did not have to tolerate being accused of violent criminal acts\\nwithout such statements being supported by facts.\\nVăcean v. Romania\\n16 November 2021\\nThe applicant, a music professor, complained of a breach of his right to reputation on\\naccount of the publication in 2011, on a number of newspapers’ websites, of an interview\\nwith video and several articles alleging that he had committed a theft in 2008.\\nThe material in question was circulating on the Internet at a time when the applicant\\nwas due to be appointed as director of the Philharmonic Orchestra, having obtained first\\nplace in the competitive examination. The police subsequently confirmed to the\\nmunicipal authorities that the applicant had not been investigated for theft, and he was\\nappointed as director of the orchestra. The applicant alleged that the national authorities\\nhad failed in their obligation to protect his right to respect for his private life.\\nThe Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private\\nand family life) of the Convention, finding that the national authorities had failed in their\\npositive obligations under that provision. It noted, In particular, that the County Court,\\nwhich had dismissed the applicant’s action in full, had not adequately examined either\\nwhether the interview and the articles complained of made a genuine contribution to a\\ndebate of public interest, or the issue of the nature of the remarks made during the\\ninterview. In the Court’s view, the County Court had not weighed the journalists’ right to\\n48Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nfreedom of expression against the applicant’s right to respect for his reputation in\\naccordance with the criteria set forth in the Court’s case-law. It noted, among other\\npoints, that the articles in question had been intended to convey an unequivocal\\nmessage to the public, namely that the applicant, future director of a public institution,\\nhad been or should have been the subject of a criminal investigation for theft. In such\\ncircumstances the County Court should have sought to ascertain whether the articles\\nhad had an objective and sufficient factual basis.\\nAlgirdas Butkevičius v. Lithuania\\n14 June 2022\\nThis case concerned a telephone conversation between the applicant – who, at the time,\\nwas the Prime Minister of Lithuania – and a mayor that was secretly recorded during a\\npre-trial investigation into possible corruption in connection with territorial planning and\\nwas made public at a hearing of the Lithuanian Parliament’s (Seima’s) Anti-Corruption\\nCommission. The applicant complained that the State authorities had breached his right\\nto private life and correspondence by disclosing the telephone conversation to the media.\\nHe submitted in particular that the prosecutor and the Anti-Corruption Commission had\\nnot properly protected that information as they had been required to by law.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life and correspondence) of the Convention in respect of the applicant, finding\\nthat, even if his reputation among his colleagues had been dinted by the disclosure of his\\ntelephone conversation, there were no factual grounds, let alone evidence, to indicate\\nthat it had been affected to a disproportionate degree. The Court noted in particular that\\nthe applicant had not pointed to any concrete and tangible repercussions which the\\nmedia’s disclosure of the telephone conversation had had on his private life, all the more\\nso as he had not been convicted of anything and the Chief Official Ethics Commission\\nhad established nothing untoward in the conversation. It also reiterated the importance\\nof public scrutiny in cases of possible political corruption.\\nMcCann and Healy v. Portugal\\n20 September 2022\\nThis case concerned statements made by a former detective inspector – in a book,\\na documentary and a newspaper interview – about the applicants’ alleged involvement\\nin the disappearance of their daughter, Madeleine McCann, who went missing on\\n3 May 2007 in southern Portugal. Before the Court, the applicants alleged that there had\\nbeen a violation of their right to reputation and to their right to be presumed innocent.\\nThe Court held that there had been no violation of Article 8 (right to respect for\\nprivate life) of the Convention, finding that it could not be stated that the national\\nauthorities had failed in their positive obligation to protect the applicants’ right to respect\\nfor their private life. It considered in particular that, even assuming that the applicants’\\nreputation had been damaged, this was not on account of the argument put forward\\nby the book’s author but rather as a result of the suspicions expressed against them,\\nwhich had led to their being placed under investigation in the course of the criminal\\ninvestigation (the prosecutor’s office decided to take no further action in July 2008) and\\nhad led to intense media attention and much controversy. The information had thus\\nbeen brought to the public’s attention in some detail even before the investigation file\\nwas made available to the media and the book in question was published. The Court\\nfurther declared inadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, the applicants’ complaint\\nunder Article 6 § 2 (presumption of innocence) of the Convention, finding that in the its\\njudgments of January and March 2017 – concerning the civil claims lodged by the\\napplicants – the Supreme Court of Portugal had not made comments implying any guilt\\non the part of the applicants or even suggesting suspicions against them with regard to\\nthe circumstances in which their daughter had disappeared.\\n49Factshe et – Protection of reputation\\nMas Gavarró v. Spain\\n18 October 2022 (decision on the admissibility)\\nThis case concerned the publication of a number of articles in the daily newspaper\\nEl Mundo which according to the applicant, who was President of the Government of\\nthe Autonomous Community of Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya) from December\\n2010 to January 2016, had damaged his reputation. The applicant complained in\\nparticular of the inaction of the police, the prosecution service and the domestic courts\\nin failing to investigate the alleged interference with his right to the protection of his\\npersonal reputation.\\nThe Court declared the application inadmissible, as being manifestly ill-founded, finding\\nthat the applicant had failed to show that the State had offered him insufficient\\nprotection and that there had been an infringement of his right to respect for his\\nreputation. It noted in particular that, as the Spanish Government had pointed out,\\nthe applicant could have brought an action for the publication of a correction in the\\nnewspaper within three days, or could have initiated the special procedure for the\\nprotection of the right to one’s honour in order to obtain redress for the alleged damage\\nto his reputation. However, by choosing only to use the criminal-law avenue,\\nthe applicant had deprived himself of the possibility of securing redress for the alleged\\ninfringement of his rights through the civil procedure available to him. He had thus\\nlimited the scope of the examination by the domestic courts, which had been able only to\\nrule on the lack of gravity of the alleged damage for the purposes of the criminal law.\\nSee also, among other recent judgments or decisions:\\nTamiz v. the United Kingdom\\n19 September 2017 (decision on the admissibility)\\nFaludy-Kovács v.

It applies not only to \"information\" and \"ideas\" that are favourably\\nreceived, regarded as inoffensive, or which leave one indifferent, but also to those that offend, shock or\\ndisturb - it implies pluralism, tolerance and openness, without which there is no \"democratic society\".\\nThe Court has emphasised that freedom of expression is subject to exceptions, but these must be\\ninterpreted narrowly, as the need to restrict it must be convincingly established. The adjective \"necessary\"\\nin Article 10 § 2 implies a \"pressing social need\". This provision leaves little room for restrictions on\\nfreedom of expression in two areas: political speech and matters of public interest. Contracting States\\nhave a certain margin of appreciation in judging the existence of such a need, but this is coupled with\\nEuropean supervision of both the law and the decisions applying it, even when they emanate from an\\nindependent court.\\nThis factsheet sets out a number of examples of general and, where appropriate, individual measures\\nadopted and reported by States, in the context of the execution of judgments of the European Court, to\\nsafeguard and protect freedom of expression, including safety of journalists, freedom of the press and\\nprotection of journalistic sources, media pluralism and broadcasting licences, freedom of commercial and\\nartistic expression, dissemination of information for electoral purposes, protection of the reputation and\\nrights of others and proportionality in the application of the law and sanctions, freedom of expression in\\nthe context of national security, public safety and anti-terrorism, and the reception of information from\\nprisoners in penal institutions\\nPage | 2\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\n1. SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS\\nIn 2000, the European Court found that the authorities had failed to protect the life of the UKR / Gongadze\\napplicant\\'s husband. The applicant\\'s husband, a journalist known for his criticism of those in (34056/02)\\npower, had been threatened by unknown persons before being abducted and found dead. The\\nJudgment final on\\nCourt also found that there was no effective remedy for the journalist\\'s disappearance and\\n08/02/2006\\ndeath for over four years.\\nAfter the European Court ruling, three police officers were convicted in 2008 for the kidnapping Interim Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2009)74\\nand murder of the journalist. In addition, in 2019, parliamentary hearings on the safety of\\njournalists took place. The parliamentary hearings recommended the creation of a national\\nrapid response mechanism for the protection of journalists, including a government hotline.\\nThe modalities of such a mechanism, including an online platform, were discussed at two online\\nevents in 2020.\\nIn addition, a draft law broadening the definition of “journalist” and increasing the liability for\\noffences against journalists was registered in Parliament in 2020. Specialised training for judges,\\nprosecutors and police officers on the protection of journalists has been developed jointly by\\nthe National School of Magistrates, the Prosecutors\\' Training Centre and the National Academy\\nof the Interior, and with the support of the Council of Europe.\\nPage | 3\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\n2. PRESS AND JOURNALISTIC FREEDOM\\nAmendment of the Constitution to facilitate the direct application by domestic courts of the NOR / Tønsbergs Blad AS\\nprinciples laid down by the European Court and Haukom\\n(510/04)\\nIn response to the European Court\\'s findings in this case, concerning a private criminal\\nconviction for defamation in which the applicants (the publishing company of the regional daily Judgment final on\\nnewspaper Tønsberg Blad) were punished for publishing press articles about an alleged breach 01/06/2007\\nof the permanent residence requirement, the authorities stated that the applicants\\' criminal\\nFinal Resolution\\nrecords did not contain any reference to the conviction.\\nCM/ResDH(2009)7\\nIn addition, measures to facilitate the direct application by the courts of the European Court\\'s\\nprinciples on freedom of expression have been adopted. The European Convention was\\nintroduced into Norwegian law by the 1999 Act, which states that the Convention takes\\nprecedence over domestic law. In 2004, after the facts of this case, the article in the\\nConstitution on freedom of expression was amended to the effect that no one can be held\\nresponsible for communicating or receiving information or ideas on the grounds of freedom of\\nexpression, the search for truth, the defence of democracy and the freedom of all persons to\\nform their own opinions. According to the authorities, the application of the Constitution in the\\nlight of the case law of the Supreme Court and the European Court will ensure a proper balance\\nbetween the right to freedom of expression and other rights.\\nEnactment of a law to clarify the conditions on the obligation to obtain authorisation for a POL / Wizerkaniuk\\npublication or citation (18990/05)\\nIn relation to a criminal conviction of an editor and co-owner of a local newspaper for publishing Judgment final on\\nan interview with a local MP without obtaining his prior permission, a 2017 law amended the 05/10/2011\\nprovisions challenged by the European Court. The most important change is the clarification of\\nthe requirement for permission to publish or quote. Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2019)98\\nAccording to the law, publishing or quoting without permission is no longer a crime but a\\nmisdemeanour subject to a fine. Thus, a journalist may not be punished for publishing a\\nstatement in full compliance with the original statement, even if he or she does not fully meet\\nthe permission requirements. In addition, the rules that a journalist cannot prevent the\\ninterviewee from giving permission for the dissemination of a statement and the exception that\\npermission is not required if the statement has already been published have been retained.\\nChange in domestic case law towards a balance between freedom of information and opinion, PRT / Medipress-Sociedade\\nand the right to honour, name and reputation Jornalística e Editorial, Lda\\n(55442/12)\\nFollowing the Court\\'s judgment in the civil suit against the applicant press company for damage\\nto the reputation of the then Prime Minister as a result of the publication of a press article in a Judgment final on\\nmagazine owned by the applicant, the authorities pointed to a development in domestic case- 30/11/2016\\nlaw. This development concerns the balance between the right to freedom of information and\\nFinal Resolution\\nopinion and the individual right to honour and reputation. In this way, Supreme Court\\nCM/ResDH(2019)201\\njudgments reproduce considerations taken from the case law of the European Court, and reject\\nclaims for damages if the Supreme Court considers that the challenged press articles represent\\nPage | 4\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\nopinions (value judgments) formulated in the context of a public debate of general interest,\\nwhile respecting the limits of reasonable criticism.\\nLegislative reform on access to court files and softening of the notion of PRT / Colaço Mestre and\\n\"secrecy\". Sociedade Independente de\\nComunicação\\nIn order to prevent a recurrence of a violation of the Convention concerning the sentencing of (11182/03+)\\na journalist to a fine or an alternative sentence of 86 days imprisonment for violation of the\\n\"secrecy of investigation\" or \"secrecy of justice\" (segredo de justiça), the 2007 law amended Judgment final on\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure by authorising the revision of judgments that had become res 26/07/2007\\njudicata. Revision can be requested by the public prosecutor and by the convicted person.\\nFinal Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2015)115\\nThe Criminal Procedure Code applicable during the period of the facts provided that all parties\\nand other persons having access to the file were bound by the segredo de justiça as long as the\\ncase was pending before the investigating judge. With the entry into force of the 2007 law, the\\n\"segredo de justiça\" is no longer applied automatically for the pre-trial period, but only upon a\\nspecific decision taken by the investigating judge or by the public prosecutor under the\\nsupervision of the investigating judge. The authorities point out that, in practice, prison\\nsentences for defamation are not handed down.\\nChanging case law to analyse and balance freedom of expression and protection of reputation SVN / Mladina d.d.\\nLjubljana\\nIn response to the European Court\\'s findings on the balance between the right of a publisher\\n(20981/10)\\n(weekly newspaper Mladina) to freedom of expression, due to the publication of a polemical\\njournalistic article, and the right of a parliamentarian to the protection of his reputation, the Judgment final on\\nConstitutional Court changed its case law with the aim of striking a fair balance between the 17/07/2014\\ntwo rights in question. Thus, in a 2014 decision on a similar case, the Constitutional Court found\\nFinal Resolution\\na violation of freedom of expression and therefore referred the case back to the judge of the\\nCM/ResDH(2017)111\\nprevious instance so that a new decision could be adopted in line with the European Court\\'s\\nruling.\\nLegislative amendments and changes in case law on the seizure, prohibition and obstruction TUR / Saygılı and Bilgiç\\nof publications (33667/05)\\nFollowing the European Court ruling on the closure of a newspaper for a period of 30 days, the Judgment final on\\nauthorities indicated that the warrants for the seizure and closure of the newspaper had been 20/08/2010\\nrevoked.\\nFinal Resolution\\nIn addition, legislative amendments were adopted in 2012, providing that previous decisions CM/ResDH(2019)26\\non seizure, prohibition, obstruction of distribution and sale of printed publications became ipso\\nfacto null and void. The provisions of the 2004 Press Act, which entered into force after the\\nfacts of the case, require objective and impartial assessment criteria for the seizure of\\npublications and must be based on a judicial decision. In addition, the Criminal Procedure Code,\\nwhich was enacted after the facts of this case, provides that confiscation warrants can only be\\nissued in cases of strong suspicion or concrete evidence of a crime.\\nAs regards domestic case law, and following the Court\\'s judgment, the respondent State\\nprovided concrete examples of effective application of the Press Law by the courts of first\\ninstance.\\nPage | 5\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\nLegislative developments to ensure the implementation of the right to unhindered freedom UKR / Ukrainian Media\\nof expression Group\\n(72713/01)\\nIn order to remedy the damage caused by a civil defamation conviction in 2000, following the\\npublication of two press articles criticising political candidates, the authorities have indicated Judgment final on\\nthat the defamation legislation was amended by the 2003 Act. Thus, a new section was added 12/10/2005\\nto the law allowing for the exemption of value judgements from liability. The term “value\\nFinal Resolution\\njudgment” is defined as \"expressions which contain no factual information\" and which \"cannot\\nCM/ResDH(2007)13\\nbe proved or disproved\".\\nFurther amendments were introduced by a 2006 law, according to which state bodies and local\\nautonomous governments cannot claim compensation for moral damage for the publication of\\nfalse information, although they can request to exercise their right of reply. The law provides\\nfor the defence of \"publication in good faith\". As such, journalists and media outlets are exempt\\nfrom liability for publishing false information, if a court establishes that the journalist acted in\\ngood faith and verified the information. In this context, compensation for non-material damage\\ncan only be imposed in case of malicious intent on the part of the journalist or the publication.\\nMalicious intent is defined as the dissemination of false information with the aim of\\ndestabilising society.\\nFurthermore, one of the articles amended in the Civil Code in 2005 provides that an individual\\ndisseminating information obtained from official sources is not obliged to verify its authenticity\\nand cannot be held responsible if the information is disproved. However, information obtained\\nfrom official sources must be accompanied by notification of the source.\\nPage | 6\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\n3. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PROTECTION OF\\nJOURNALISTIC SOURCES\\nPromulgation of a law on the protection of journalistic sources BEL / Ernst and Others\\n(33400/96)\\nFollowing the Court\\'s judgment on the searches of the homes and business premises of the\\napplicants, four journalists and two journalists\\' associations, some of the objects and Judgment final on\\ndocuments that had been seized were returned, while the rest were no longer of interest to 15/10/2003\\nthem.\\nFinal Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2010)39\\nIn 2005, a law on the protection of journalistic sources was adopted, after the facts of the case,\\nwhich prohibits the search for such sources, including through search or seizure. The only\\nexception to this prohibition is provided for by the law, at the request of a judge, is if they are\\nof a nature to prevent the commission of offences constituting a serious threat to the physical\\nintegrity of one or more persons and if the information requested is of crucial importance and\\ncannot be obtained in any other way.\\nAdoption of a law on freedom of expression in the media and protection of journalistic LUX / Roemen and Schmit\\nsources (51772/99)\\nIn order to remedy the negative consequences of the violation, the document seized during the Judgment final on\\nsearches was returned and the judicial investigation was closed. 25/05/2003\\nThe 2004 Law on Freedom of Expression in the Media contains a specific section on the\\nFinal Resolution\\nprotection of journalistic sources, stating that the right to such protection is not limited to cases CM/ResDH(2011)127\\nwhere a journalist is involved in a procedure as a witness.\\nIn order to resolve the conflict between the right to protection of sources and the obligation to\\nprove the veracity of the alleged facts, in criminal proceedings for defamation or in civil\\nproceedings for injury to a person\\'s honour or reputation, the law provides that the journalist\\nmay avoid liability either by proving the veracity of the allegations or by proving that sufficient\\nsteps were taken to conclude that the facts reported were true and that the public had an\\noverriding interest in knowing the information in question.

Paid television advertising was the only way for the small party to get its\\nmessage across to the public.\\nFinal Resolution\\nIn 2009, following the Court\\'s ruling, the authorities cancelled the fine issued by the National CM/ResDH(2011)234\\nMedia Authority. In addition, legislative amendments were passed in 2009 that required the\\nnational television station (NRK) to provide broad and balanced election coverage and to ensure\\nthat small political parties be also included in NRK\\'s editorial coverage. These parties also now\\nhave access to the new television channel \"Frikanalen\". Thus, the authorities have noted that,\\nin the September 2009 parliamentary elections, the political party in this case and other similar\\npolitical parties were effectively included in the election coverage of NRK and \"Frikanalen\".\\nImproving the rules on publication and advertising during election periods and establishing TUR / Erdoğan Gökçe\\nadministrative fines instead of prison sentences (31736/04)\\nThe European Court ruled on the violation of freedom of expression in relation to the criminal Judgment final on\\nsanction of a candidate in the municipal elections for issuing a press release before the election 14/01/2015\\nperiod. As a result, the authorities reported that the criminal court had erased the conviction\\nfrom the candidate’s criminal record. Final resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2017)92\\nThe violation stemmed from the application of the provisions of the Law on \"Basic Provisions\\nGoverning Elections and Voter Registration\", which prohibited candidates from campaigning\\nprior to ten days before the elections. The authorities pointed out that this law was amended\\nin 2008, after the events of this case, establishing that sanctions for disobeying election rules\\ncould only include administrative fines and no longer prison sentences.

In order to remedy the negative Judgment final on\\nconsequences, the authorities indicated that the public reprimand was never implemented due 20/07/2006\\nto the statute of limitations. Moreover, following the European Court\\'s judgment, in 2007, the\\nSupreme Court of Cassation granted the reopening of the criminal proceedings, quashed the Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2011)5\\nconviction and pronounced an acquittal. It based its judgment on the findings of the European\\nCourt.\\nFurthermore, following the amendments to the Penal Code adopted in 2000, insult is no longer\\npunishable by imprisonment. Furthermore, case law is constantly developing in the direction of\\ntaking better account of the Convention and the case law of the European Court.\\nCase law balancing the right to freedom of expression and the protection of honour ESP / Otegi Mondragon\\n(2034/07)\\nThe European Court found a violation of Article 10 in relation to a one-year prison sentence for\\nserious defamation of the King. The authorities indicated that no sentence of deprivation of Judgment final on\\nliberty had been served, the execution of the conviction had been suspended by a court order 15/09/2011\\nof 2006 and the mention of the conviction had been erased from the applicant\\'s criminal record.\\nFinal Resolution\\nAs regards domestic case law, in 2015, the Constitutional Court established that the article on CM/ResDH(2017)251\\ndefamation in the Criminal Code should be applied in line with the case law of the European\\nCourt. The Court recalls the need to strike a proper balance between the right to freedom of\\nexpression and the protection of honour.

In this\\nway, the Supreme Court considers that there is neither insult nor slander when it comes to the\\nlegitimate exercise of the right to freely express and disseminate truthful information, thoughts,\\nideas and opinions. This Court has concluded that criminal law is too harsh an instrument and\\nthat other legal remedies may be more appropriate.\\nLegislative reform on non-defamatory expression FIN / Nikula\\n(31611/96)\\nThe European Court ruled that there had been a violation of Article 10 in respect of a\\ndisproportionate criminal conviction for defamation for remarks the applicant had made as a Judgment final on\\nlawyer during a pleading. As a result of the European Court\\'s judgment, no mention of the 21/06/2002\\nconviction appears in the applicant\\'s criminal record.\\nFinal resolution\\nMoreover, legislative measures were taken in 2000, after the events that gave rise to this case ResDH(2006)51\\nand before the European Court had found a violation, to prevent similar violations in the future,\\nnotably with the reform of the Penal Code by the 2000 Act. According to the legislation, as\\namended, criticism of a person\\'s conduct in the exercise of his or her political or professional\\nactivities, public functions or titles, scientific or artistic activities, is not considered to be\\ndefamation when the criticism does not manifestly exceed the limits of acceptable conduct.\\nRepeal of the offence of insulting the Head of State FRA / Eon\\n(26118/10)\\nThe European Court found a violation of Article 10 in relation to a suspended fine for offending\\nthe Head of State. In order to prevent similar violations, the authorities have indicated that the Judgment final on\\n2013 law, providing for adaptation provisions in the field of justice in application of EU law, 14/06/2013\\nrepealed the article of the 1881 law relating to the offence of insulting the Head of State.\\nFinal Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2014)10\\nChange in case law on the offence of publishing information about civil claims FRA / Du Roy and Malaurie\\n(34000/96)\\nFollowing the European Court\\'s judgment on a criminal conviction for the offence of\\n\"publication of information relating to civil claims\", the conviction no longer appears in the Judgment final on\\napplicants\\' criminal record. 03/01/2001\\nIn addition, in two successive judgments in 2001, the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation\\nFinal Resolution\\nheld that the 1931 Act, by its general and absolute prohibition, restricts the protection of the CM/ResDH(2008)9\\nlegitimate interests enumerated in Article 10 and, being incompatible with that provision,\\ncannot be used as a basis for a criminal conviction.

Final Resolution\\nRecent case law from the Court of Cassation shows a more explicit appropriation of the criteria CM/ResDH(2019)88\\nof the European Court\\'s case law on freedom of expression in order to assess the\\nproportionality of sanctions for statements made. Thus, in rulings handed down in 2015, 2016\\nand 2017, the Court of Cassation refers to the distinction between \"statements of fact\" and\\n\"value judgments\" and to the notion of \"debate of general interest\". It therefore incorporated\\ninto its reasoning one of the essential criteria used by the European Court to determine whether\\nthe impugned remarks were part of a debate of general interest, in order to take a more open\\nview on remarks that could be made in this context. The Court of Cassation examines these\\nstatements, checking that they have sufficient factual basis and that they do not exceed the\\nadmissible limits of freedom of expression. Finally, it considers that it is up to the trial judge to\\ncheck the proportionality of the sentence in the light of Article 10.\\nDeclaration of unconstitutionality of a legal provision prohibiting a person sued for FRA / Mamère\\ndefamation from exonerating himself from responsibility for facts that date back more than (12697/03)\\nten years\\nJudgment final on\\nThe European Court found that the criminal conviction for defamation to pay a fine and 07/02/2007\\ndamages was contrary to the Convention. In 2011, the authorities indicated that the\\nConstitutional Council declared that the 1881 legislative provision on freedom of the press, Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2011)104\\nwhich prohibits a person prosecuted for defamation from exonerating himself or herself from\\nliability when the accusation refers to facts that date back to more than ten years, was contrary\\nto the Constitution. The Constitutional Council specified that this declaration of\\nunconstitutionality is applicable to all defamatory allegations that have not been finally judged\\non the day of publication of its decision.\\nCase law developments concerning the acceptable level of criticism of public figures SER / Lepojić and Filipović\\n(13909/05)\\nThe European Court found unjustified interference with the freedom of expression of the\\napplicants, local politicians, who were convicted in criminal proceedings for defamation or Judgment final on\\ncontempt, and then ordered in civil proceedings to pay substantial damages in compensation 31/03/2008\\nto the same plaintiff, a mayor, who was also the director of a state company.\\nFinal Resolution\\nIn 2008, the Supreme Court issued a legal opinion, allowing the direct application of the CM/ResDH(2009)135\\nEuropean Court\\'s case law in domestic law. In this way, the degree of acceptable criticism is\\nmuch wider for public figures than for individuals. This opinion is legally binding on all lower\\ncourts in the country. The authorities have also provided information on a judgment delivered\\nby the Court of First Instance in 2008.

The law further specifies that everyone, with the exception of public officials,\\nenjoys freedom of expression, which includes freedom of opinion and freedom of political\\nspeech and debate. It distinguishes between defamation committed against an individual and\\ndefamation committed against a public figure. Thus, in the case of defamation of a public figure,\\nthe journalist is only civilly liable if he or she knew that the fact was wrong. The law provides\\nthat no one can be convicted of defamation if he or she did not know, or could not have known,\\nthat the defamatory statements were being broadcast or were going to be broadcast.\\nEnactment of a media and defamation law to strengthen the right to freedom of expression MLT / Falzon\\n(45791/13)\\nThe civil fine for defamation for writing articles criticising Parliament was found to be in\\nviolation of Article 10 by the European Court. In order to prevent similar violations, the new Judgment final on\\nMedia and Defamation Act 2018 repealed and replaced the law in force at the time, with the 20/06/2018\\nmain aim of strengthening the right to freedom of expression. Prior to the introduction of the\\nnew law, there was no definition of \\'defamation\\' in the legislation. Under the new law, the Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2019)122\\nnotion of \\'serious harm\\' to a person\\'s reputation has been introduced into the definition of\\ndefamation, which is listed as “communicating a statement that seriously damages a person\\'s\\nreputation and includes defamation and slander”.\\nFurthermore, criminal actions for defamation are no longer possible and all criminal\\nproceedings that were pending before the court at the time of the introduction of the law have\\nbeen discontinued. Therefore, actions against defamatory libel can only be brought before the\\ncivil courts.\\nPage | 18\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\n8. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND NATIONAL SECURITY,\\nPUBLIC SAFETY AND COUNTER-TERRORISM\\nLegislative amendment on the punishment of acts disturbing the public peace and violating HUN / Vajnai\\nthe human dignity of victims of totalitarian systems (33629/06)\\nFollowing the Court\\'s ruling on the criminal convictions of members of a left-wing political party Judgment final on\\nand confiscations for wearing a red star symbol during peaceful and legally organised 08/10/2008\\ndemonstrations, the trials were reopened before the Supreme Court, which overturned the\\njudgments and issued acquittals. As a result, the convictions were removed from the criminal Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2019)346\\nrecords.\\nAt the time of the events, the dissemination or public use of a swastika, SS badge, cross arrow,\\nsickle and hammer symbol or red star were punishable offences by fine in the Criminal Code. In\\nFebruary 2013, the Constitutional Court annulled this provision and the Criminal Code was\\namended in April 2013. The amendment establishes that the dissemination or use of the above-\\nmentioned symbols must be presumed likely to disturb the public peace and offend the human\\ndignity of victims of totalitarian systems or the respect due to the dead. Thus, the ban no longer\\ncriminalises the \"mere display\" of a Red Star symbol in an \"indiscriminate\" manner. The\\nprohibition thus makes it possible to exclude from its scope of application activities and ideas\\nthat clearly belong to those protected by Article 10 of the Convention.\\nRepeal of an article of the anti-terrorism legislation TUR / Arslan\\n(23462/94)\\nThe European Court examined criminal convictions by the State Security Courts under the Anti-\\nTerrorism Act in relation to the publication of articles and books and the preparation of Judgment final on\\nmessages addressed to the public that were considered terrorist to be propaganda. Section 8 08/07/1999\\nof the Anti-Terrorism Act applicable at the time punished propaganda for terrorism via written\\nmaterial, books or the press. As a consequence of the European Court\\'s ruling, Article 8 of the Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2006)79\\nAnti-Terrorism Act was repealed by Law No. 4928 of 2003 and, consequently, any mention of\\ncriminal convictions in the criminal record was deleted. The 2003 Act aims to bring domestic\\nlaw into line with the requirements of the Convention.\\nLegislative amendment concerning the facilitation of the activities of a gang or an armed TUR / Emir\\nillegal organisation (10054/03)\\nThe European Court found a violation of Article 10 in relation to a conviction, under the Judgment final on\\napplication of the former Penal Code, for \"facilitating the activities of an armed gang or 03/08/2007\\norganisation\" because of the publication in a magazine of a series of articles reporting on the\\nintervention of law enforcement agencies in Turkish prisons. Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2009)17\\nFollowing the European Court\\'s ruling, the conviction was deleted from the criminal record.\\nFurthermore, in order to prevent similar situations, the 2003 law partially amended the Criminal\\nCode by deleting the reference to \"facilitating the activities of a gang or an armed illegal\\norganisation\". This reference does not appear in the new Code of Criminal Procedure, which\\nentered into force in 2005.\\nPage | 19\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\nAmendment clarifying that the expression of \"ill will\" or \"hostility between different TUR / Foka\\nhostility between different communities\" are not considered \"seditious intent\". (28940/95)\\n\"seditious intent\".\\nJudgment final on\\nIn response to the European Court\\'s findings on the confiscation of tapes, books, a notebook 26/01/2009\\nand cards by the authorities, measures were taken to promote freedom of expression. In 2007,\\nsubsequent to the facts of the judgment, an amendment to the Criminal Code was introduced Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2015)153\\nso that the promotion of \"feelings of ill will\" and \"hostility between different communities\" or\\nclasses of people are no longer considered \"seditious intent\".\\nThus, publishing or disseminating words or materials that promote ill will between communities\\nwill no longer be considered an offence under the criminal law. This amendment will ensure\\nthat any confiscation of materials or items on similar grounds will no longer have a legal basis\\nfor the purposes of Article 10.\\nPage | 20\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\n9. RECEPTION OF INFORMATION AND FREEDOM OF\\nEXPRESSION OF PRISONERS IN PENAL INSTITUTIONS\\nAmendment to the Execution of Sentences Act providing that disciplinary sanctions shall not BGR / Shahanov and\\nbe delivered to prisoners for making requests or complaints Palfreeman\\n(35365/12)\\nFollowing the sanctions imposed on the prisoners (10-days\\' isolation and 3-months\\' deprivation\\nof food parcels respectively) and imposed by the prison authorities in response to complaints Judgment final on\\nagainst prison officers, the authorities indicated that they had adopted measures after the 21/10/2016\\nevent. The sanctions imposed were authorised by the law in force at the time of the events as\\nFinal Resolution\\n\"defamatory statements or false allegations against prison officers\".\\nCM/ResDH(2017)256\\nThis 2009 law on the execution of sentences and pre-trial detention was amended in 2013. The\\namendment provides that prisoners should not be disciplined for making requests or\\ncomplaints. Now, physical violence or threats of violence against fellow inmates or prison\\nofficers continue to be disciplinary offences within the prison, but there is no mention of\\ndefamatory statements or false allegations against prison officers or other inmates as grounds\\nfor imposing a disciplinary sanction. Therefore, disciplinary sanctions can now only be imposed\\nin situations not related to previous complaints.\\nAmendment of the Imprisonment Act to facilitate access to Internet sites in prisons EST / Kalda\\n(17429/10)\\nIn 2019, the authorities amended the section of the Imprisonment Act that prohibited access\\nto websites in prison other than specific sites dedicated to legislative and judicial records. The Judgment final on\\namendment allows prisoners to access the websites in question in this case, including the 06/06/2016\\nChancellor of Justice and the Council of Europe in Tallinn (the Riigikogu\\'s website). However,\\nthe authorities have informed that the sites need to be adjusted to block access to other links Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2019)109\\nthat remain prohibited.\\nNew legislation to improve access to websites in prisons LIT / Jankovskis\\n(21575/08)\\nIn 2014, access to a number of websites was granted to prisoners in penal institutions through\\nLimited Internet Access (LIA). In order to ensure the uniform application of LIA in all penitentiary Judgment final on\\ninstitutions, the Prison Service issued the LIA guidelines for inmates and convicts. In these 17/04/2017\\nguidelines it was stipulated that each facility should have a description of the procedure for\\nusing the Internet, a list of accessible websites and the rights and obligations of LIA users. As a Final Resolution\\nCM/ResDH(2019)73\\nresult of the recommendations given, the prisons adopted the rules of use for Internet access.\\nIn 2017, an order approved written procedure for using the LIA, specifying that equal conditions\\nof access be ensured for all. Thus, a detainee or prisoner wishing to have access to the LIA must\\nsubmit a request to the head of his or her unit. Taking into account the websites most frequently\\nrequested by detainees, 21 additional websites have been authorised. The list is not exhaustive,\\nand detainees may continue to request access to other websites.\\nPage | 21\\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\\nhttps://www.coe.int/en/web/executionDEPARTMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS\\nSERVICE DE L’EXÉCUTION DES ARRÊTS DE LA COUR EUROPÉENNE DES DROITS DE L’HOMME Thematic factsheet\\nINDEX OF CASES\\nARM / Meltex and Mesrop Movsesyan ............................. 9 MON / Šabanović............................................................. 17\\nAUT / Informationsverein Lentia and Others .................... 9 NLD / Telegraaf Media Nederland Landelijke Media b.v.\\nBEL / Ernst and Others ....................................................... 7 and Others ..................................................................... 8\\nBGR / Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Anatoliy Elenkov ........... 9 NLD / Voskuil ..................................................................... 7\\nBGR / Raichinov................................................................ 14 NOR / Becker ..................................................................... 8\\nBGR / Shahanov and Palfreeman .................................... 21 NOR / Tønsbergs Blad AS and Haukom ............................ 4\\nCRO / Slava Jurišić ............................................................ 16 NOR / TV Vest As and Rogaland Pensjonistparti ............ 12\\nESP / Otegi Mondragon ................................................... 14 POL / Wizerkaniuk ............................................................. 4\\nESP / Rodriguez Ravelo .................................................... 14 PRT / Colaço Mestre and Sociedade Independente de\\nEST / Kalda ....................................................................... 21 Comunicação ................................................................. 5\\nFIN / Nikula ...................................................................... 15 PRT / Medipress-Sociedade Jornalística e Editorial, Lda .. 4\\nFRA / Du Roy and Malaurie ............................................. 15 ROM / Dalban .................................................................. 17\\nFRA / Eon .......................................................................... 15 SER / Lepojić and Filipović ............................................... 16\\nFRA / Jean-Jacques Morel Group ..................................... 15 SVN / Mladina d.d.
